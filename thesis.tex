\title{Capturing Mobile Security Policies Precisely} 
\author{Joseph Hallett}
\submityear{2017} 
\abstract{%

  This thesis looks at developing an authorization logic to describe the
  informal security policies in the mobile ecosystem. Natural language policies describe
  BYOD agreements and terms and conditions. Users have privacy preferences that
  they may never express as a policy but which guide their actions. Software
  running on mobile devices has trust relationships with servers and stores.
  Whilst earlier work has looked on checking and enforcing policies with low-level
  controls, this work aims to capture these informal policy's intents and the trust
  relationships within them separating the policy specification from its
  enforcement. This allows us to analyze the informal policies precisely, measure
  their use in practice, and look for idioms.

  We show how AppPAL instantiates SecPAL and our implementation of it as an
  authorization logic for mobile ecosystems. We show how we can check AppPAL
  policies for common errors. Using AppPAL we show that policies describing users
  privacy preferences do not seem to match the apps users install. We explore the
  differences between app stores and how to create new ones based on policy. We
  look at five BYOD policies and discover previously unexamined idioms within
  them.

    %I am grateful to many people for their help in completing my PhD. In
    %particular I would like to thank the following people:
    %
    %Thank you to my supervisors David Aspinall and Bj\"orn Franke for their
    %advice, criticism, help, patience, and always offering to edit my papers.
    %Thank you to Andy Gordon and Martin Hofmann for the helpful discussions early on,
    %introducing me to SecPAL and to using formal logic to model this domain.
    %Thank you to Daniel Franzen, Marcin Szymczak, Arthur Chan, Catherine Crompton and
    %the rest of IF~5.24 for listening to my rants and helpful discussions over the
    %years. Thank you to Dan Page for his help early in my career, and for suggesting
    %I apply for this job. A second thank you to David Aspinall for helping me move
    %back home to be a proper father to my son, before I really should have and for
    %sorting out the paperwork when the university eventually noticed. Thank you to my
    %friends and family for supporting me over the past years, especially Di for her
    %camaraderie in completing this. Thank you to EasyJet for roughly 307 safe flights
    %between Ediburgh and Bristol (and one slightly terrifying one).

    %Finally, thank you to Emma and Jim. Thank you Emma for your unwavering
    %support and for letting me work when I should be helping with the baby, and
    %thankyou Jim for keeping me awake and writing at all hours.
