  to be able to talk about it.  This is basically related work, but only the
  \emph{really} pertinent stuff.}

\subsection{App Stores}\label{app-stores}

The Play Store is Google's marketplace for apps. It contains a large
number of apps (around 2.2 million) uploaded by developers for users to
buy. To use the market places user's can login with a Google account
which is then used to sync purchases to their devices. Developers pay a
small fee (currently \$25) to submit an app to the store.

Google publish guidelines for developers wanting to publish
apps\footnote{\url{https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/}}.
These guidelines describe what content is acceptable, how developers may
publicise their app and request feedback as well as what kinds of
advertising is acceptable. Apps are inspected by Google before
publication; a somewhat secretive process that includes static analysis
as well as dynamic analysis using their \emph{Bouncer} tool
\cite{oberheide_dissecting_2012}.

Whilst the Play store may be the \emph{official} Android app marketplace
it is not the only way to install apps. Apps can be sideloaded
(installed) by asking the operating system to install the APK file (the
file format of an Android app) directly. Alternatively a third-party
store can be installed which will allow users to buy and sideload apps.

These third-party stores exist for a variety of reasons. Some such as
\emph{Qihoo 360 Mobile Assistant} and \emph{Baidu App Store} exist to cater to
the Chinese market, which has not traditionally had access to Google's services
for political reasons. Others such as the \emph{Amazon Appstore}\footnote{The
Amazon app store is also available to all devices, and aims to be similar to the
Google Play store, but with a more stringent review process.}, \emph{Sony Xperia
Apps} or \emph{Samsung Galaxy Apps} exist as curated app stores featuring apps
highlighting a particular device's features. There are app stores for open
source apps like \emph{F-Droid}. There are app stores for devices that can't (or
don't want to) pass the CTS and CDD like \emph{Yandex} and \emph{Aptoide}.

Each store comes with its own terms and conditions, some of which are
summarised in Table \url{tab:store-summary}. A user who does not wish to
be given updates might wish to use the Amazon store as it does not force
them to be installed. A developer who wishes to sell pornographic apps,
might want to use Yandex's store as many others prohibit them.

The only way to distinguish between these app stores is by
careful consideration of their advertising and terms and conditions.

\section{SecPAL}

SecPAL was originally intended to model and enforce access control policies
    in grid computing systems~\cite{becker_secpal:_2010}. Flexibility is part of
    SecPAL's goals, however. At its core, SecPAL is a language with a simple grammar
    (\autoref{fig:secpal-grammar}) and three evaluation rules
    (\autoref{fig:secpal-rules}). The language's simplicity makes it easy to apply
    to a new domain by instantiating it with predicates and constraints that
    describe the domain. This simplicity does not come at the cost of its
    expressiveness. SecPAL supports delegation, and arbitrary constraints, as well
    as role and attribute based policies styles. Other domains have successfully
    used variants of SecPAL to describe their policies. Humphrey~\etal{} instantiated
    SecPAL with predicates for the GridFTP protocol to create a Grid access control
    policy language~\cite{humphrey_fine-grained_2007}. Aziz~\etal{} created SecPAL4DSA
    by adding predicates for data-sharing agreements~\cite{aziz_secpal4dsa:_2011}.
    Becker~\etal{} added predicates for describing \ac{PII}-handling preferences and
    created SecPAL4P~\cite{becker_framework_2009}.
