\label{chap:related-work}
   
There has been relevant work on policy languages concurrent with our
own work capturing mobile security policies precisely. In this chapter
we give an overview of DKAL, which built on SecPAL to describe how
information could be shared. We describe XACML, an industrial standard
for describing policies.  XACML was extended recently to describe
delegation relationships. We explain our reasons for choosing SecPAL
as a basis for our work over it.

We also describe work developing fine-grained permissions systems for
Android.
