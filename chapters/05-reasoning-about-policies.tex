\chapter{Applying AppPAL to BYOD Policies}
\label{chap:byod}

Many employees bring their personal mobile devices to work. To control
the access these devices have to company resources an estimated 72\%
of companies publish \ac{BYOD} policies.\footnote{According to survey
  of companies by LinkedIn~\cite{schulze_byod_2016}. 40\% made \ac{BYOD}
  available to all employees. 32\% made it available to select
  employees.} These \ac{BYOD} policies are natural language documents
that employees should read and obey. They describe steps to take to
secure devices in the workplace. The policies say how employees should
get access to data, and who should authorize decisions.

Companies can use their policies in varying ways. Some may
trust employees to follow the rules on their own. Others may use
\ac{MDM} software to implement part of their policies. Tools such as
IBM's MaaS360 and Blackberry's BES~\cite{ibm_ibm_nodate,blackberry_secure_nodate} can
configure devices to restrict functionality and manage apps.

Commercial tools have limits to what they currently enforce. Some
tools can only enable simple on-off configuration settings, and ban
explicitly black-listed apps. More advanced systems can use
app-rewriting to recompile apps. This lets them tunnel traffic through a VPN, or use
geofencing to apply policies in predefined areas. These tools are not
infallible. One survey found that 50\% of companies with \ac{MDM}
software still had non-compliant devices in their
networks~\cite{mobileiron_security_labs_q4_2015}. Whilst app wrapping
can protect some apps, in general it is
ineffective~\cite{hao_effectiveness_2013}.

\section{Overview of Five BYOD Policies}
\label{sec:overview-of-five-byod-policies}

This chapter looks at how we can apply AppPAL to
BYOD policies.  To do this we analyze of five \emph{real-world} policies.
We chose the policies from a variety of domains.  They cover a range
of different policy styles and concerns.  Two are example policy
templates a company might want to base its own BYOD policy on,
published by security advice organizations.  The remaining three are
BYOD policies used inside companies.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is the \emph{Security Policy Template: Use of Handheld Devices
    in a Corporate Environment}. It was published by the SANS
  Institute~\cite{nicholas_r._c._guerin_security_2008}. This policy is a
  hypothetical policy published to help companies mitigate the threats
  to corporate assets caused by mobile devices. Companies change the
  document to suit their needs and BYOD requirements. The policy is
  general; not specific to any particular industry, device, or country's
  legislation.
\item Is from the \ac{HiMSS}
  \cite{healthcare_information_and_management_systems_society_mobile_2012}.
  \ac{HiMSS} is a US non-profit company trying to improve health care through IT.
  The \ac{HiMSS} policy is short and has concerns specific to
  healthcare scenarios. The policy is a contract the users follow. It has
  a different style to other policies: in the other policies the company states
  what users \emph{should} do; here the user states what they \emph{will} do. The policy is
  a sample agreement for a healthcare company managing mobile
  devices.
\item Is from a British hospital trust~\cite{kennington_mobiles_2014}.
  It describes the BYOD scheme used in practice at the hospital.  The
  policy is broad and covers rules for corporately owned devices.  This
  policy also briefly describes how devices should interact with
  patients.
\item Is from the University of
  Edinburgh~\cite{williamson_bring_2015}. It is brief. It groups
  rules into those for high and low risk users.  The policy is extremely general describing rules for
  laptops, tablets and phones.  Many of the rules are vague.
  The policy says \emph{``Use anti-virus software and keep it up
    to date''}, leaving the choice of AV software and
  update times to the user.
\item Is by a company selling emergency
  sirens~\cite{code3pse.org_sample_nodate}. Again this policy is simpler,
  and, like the Edinburgh policy, is rather general compared to the other policies.
\end{enumerate}

Each policy is split into a series of rules employees
should follow. Typically,, the policy is describing what employees should
do and what will happen under certain circumstances. For example the NHS policy
states that:

\begin{policyrule}{NHS}
  In the event of loss of the device, all data including apps will be wiped. The Trust
  is not responsible for reimbursement of any costs for personally purchased apps.
\end{policyrule}

The Siren policy matches this style. It states what conditions will lead to the
company wiping an employee's device:

\begin{policyrule}{Sirens}
The employee's device may be remotely wiped if: $\bullet$ The device is lost or
stolen. $\bullet$ The employee terminates his or her employment. $\bullet$ IT
detects a data or policy breach, a virus or similar threat to the security of
the company's data and technology infrastructure.
\end{policyrule}

The \ac{HiMSS} policy has a different style.
The equivalent rule is phrased from the perspective of the policy subject
(\emph{``I agree\dots''}).

\begin{policyrule}{HiMSS}
  I agree that the PDA/Smartphone can be wiped by XYZ Health System upon the
  decision of XYZ Health System management and understand that it will delete all
  data including personal files.
\end{policyrule}

The SANS policy is written in the same style as the NHS policy.  It is
a template policy that a company might use as the basis for their
own policy. Sometimes, however, it says things that seem like advice to the IT
department for what to look for.  For example:

\begin{policyrule}{SANS}
   A corporate mobile device management solution SHALL feature remote device
   wiping (or possibly only blocking) mechanism for all devices accessing
   corporate internal networks.
\end{policyrule}

The SANS policy also distinguishes between rules that should always be followed (SHALL),
and those that may depend on a specific business's situation (SHOULD).

\begin{policyrule}{SANS}
  Basically, sentences using the verb ``SHALL'' are mandatory requirements
  applying to practices with high probability of putting the business at risk,
  whereas ``SHOULD'' means that the policy needs to be applied according to the
  business's specific situation.
\end{policyrule}

The Edinburgh policy goes further, grouping rules by device type and
giving a security level to each rule.  The policy expects high and
medium risk users to follow everything, and low risk users to consider
following the rules marked with a $\nabla$.  For example, the policy
groups together the rule for remote wiping devices with the rules
specific to mobile devices and tablets.

\begin{policyrule}{Edinburgh}
  $\nabla$ Configure your device to enable you to remote-wipe it should it become lost.
\end{policyrule}

Our translation shows the text of the policy next to the AppPAL version in
\autoref{appendix:byod}. The rest of this chapter looks at what we
found from the translation process, and comments on \ac{MDM} policies in
general.

\section{Review of MDM software}

A company might use \ac{MDM} software to enforce their rules.  Many
vendors offer \ac{MDM} solutions: including IBM (with their tool
\emph{MaaS360}), VMware (\emph{AirWatch}) and MobileIron (whose tool
has the same name as the company). They all offer a similar set of
features, namely:
\begin{enumerate}
\item App wrapping. The tool modifies apps to offer some extra
  features or network properties. This may be limited to routing all
  the app's network traffic through a VPN.
\item Basic security configuration. Lets an administrator to turn on
  and off various settings and security features. These
  include WiFi settings, pass-codes, encryption or Bluetooth.  These
  features could be used to reduce the attack surface of a device; or enforce policies that need a user's location
  by turning on the GPS.
\item Provisioning. IT departments can install and update apps and
  their configuration files. Email and LDAP configuration is common.
\item A curated app store. IT departments can white-or-black-list apps, and offer them to employees.
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{tab:mdm-capabilities} summarizes the features of 9 competing \ac{MDM} packages identified by a Gartner
report~\cite{rob_smith_magic_2016}.  Most of
the tools link to the report on their homepages as the report lists
\emph{every} tool as either \emph{visionary}, \emph{leading}, or
\emph{niche player}. The meaning of each term is unclear, however.\footnote{Table~\ref{tab:mdm-capabilities}
  summarizes the visionary and leading \ac{MDM} packages.}  The tools are similar with the main difference being the UI
and some extra features only some tools have.

Whilst \ac{MDM} tools can configure devices, the policies they enforce are less
advanced than what can be writen using a policy language such as AppPAL. The
policies of an \ac{MDM} tool are essentially granular check boxes (shown in
\autoref{fig:maas360-policy}). An administrator can manually enable or disable features to
configure devices for users.

\subsection{Related BYOD Work}

As well as commercial \ac{MDM} products there are also research tools
that are similar to \ac{MDM} software. Martinelli~\etal{}'s work
creates a dynamic permissions manager, called UC-Droid. Their tool can
alter what an app's Android permissions are at run time, based on
policies~\cite{martinelli_enhancing_2016}.  The tool allows companies
to reconfigure their apps depending on whether the employee is at
work, in a secret lab, or working out-of-hours. These kinds of
policies are more configurable than the geo-fenced based policies some
\ac{MDM} tools offer. Other work has looked at enforcing different
policies based on what roles an employee
holds~\cite{costantino_towards_2013}. The work allowed a company to
verify the devices within their network and what servers and services
they could reach. It also describes a mechanism for providing
different users with different policies.

Armando~\etal~developed BYODroid as a tool for enforcing BYOD policies through a
secure marketplace~\cite{armando_bring_2013}. Their tool allows companies to
distribute apps through a secure app~store~\cite{armando_enabling_2014}. The
store ensures apps meet policies through a static analysis and
app rewriting to add dynamic enforcement. Their policies are low-level, based on
ConSpec~\cite{aktug_conspec_2008}; checking based on the Dalvik VM's state.
Using their tool, they implemented the parts of a NATO Communications and
Information Agency policy about personal networks and data
management~\cite{armando_developing_2016}. Their work shows how to check and enforce the app-specific
sections of a BYOD policy using tools. They did not
look at where the checks or policies come from, however.

\section{Modeling BYOD policies}

BYOD policies written in natural language can have ambiguities. Comparing
policies with different styles from different sources is tricky: the
relationships between different entities, and the exact decisions being made can
become confused. To make comparisons precise we first model the natural language
policy's rules using AppPAL. We take care to use the same predicates between
different policies to create a standard set of decisions between \ac{BYOD}
policies.

Each of the policies are split into a series of rules. A simple example is the
following example from the Sirens company policy. The rule states that devices
may get access to various company resources. For each resource we create an
AppPAL assertion stating the device may access the resource.

\begin{policyrule}{Sirens}
  Employees may use their mobile device to access the following company-owned resources:
  \newline $\bullet$ Email $\bullet$ Calendars $\bullet$ Contacts $\bullet$ Documents $\bullet$ Etc.
  \normalfont
  \begin{lstlisting}
'department' says Device:D canAccess('email').
'department' says Device:D canAccess('calendars').
'department' says Device:D canAccess('contacts').
'department' says Device:D canAccess('documents').
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{policyrule}

The NHS policy has a more complex example. Employees are not
allowed to call non-domestic, or premium rate numbers on company-owned
phones. An employee's manager, however, can make an exception.
To write it in AppPAL we first describe the
rule that bans international calls. We add a second rule stating that it is
allowed if someone exempts it. A third lets the employee's manager 
make the exemption.

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{policyrule}{NHS}
  All mobile devices will be configured for national access only. Premium/international calls will be barred.
  International call barring and roaming arrangements can be lifted for specific periods, to be stipulated on request, on approval of the relevant manager/budget holder.
  \normalfont
  \begin{lstlisting}
'nhs-trust' says Device canCall(TelephoneNumber:X)
  if Device isOwnedBy('nhs-trust'),
     X isNationalNumber, X isStandardRateNumber.

'nhs-trust' says Device canCall(TelephoneNumber:X)
  if Device isOwnedBy(Staff),
     Staff hasCallExemption.

'nhs-trust' says Manager can-say
  Staff hasCallExemption
  if Manager isManagerOf(Staff).
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{policyrule}
\end{minipage}

Table~\ref{tab:prefix} shows a count of the different predicates used in the
policies. As in \autoref{chap:apppal}, we use prefixes to distinguish
different kinds of predicates. The use of each is also split by whether the
predicate is a \emph{decision} made by the policy, or a \emph{condition} for
making that decision. \emph{Can} and \emph{must} decisions feature in all
policies, except \emph{can} decisions in the Edinburgh policy due to
its structure (as discussed in
\autoref{sec:overview-of-five-byod-policies}). This is expected.
Access control decisions and reactions to events are both topics that
\ac{MDM} tools have focused on implementing. \emph{Has} and \emph{is} predicates
are often used in the conditions.  There are also decisions using them as well.

\section{BYOD Idioms in AppPAL}
\label{sec:common_concerns}

When examining the policies, there are some concern concerns shared between the
different policies. Table~\ref{tab:common} shows predicates used in multiple
policies by our translation. The table lists predicates (and arguments) found in
multiple policies and in which policies they occurred. From it we can find
the common decisions of concern to \ac{BYOD} policies.

Acknowledgments, where the policy requests people acknowledge other
policies, and predicates linking devices to owners feature in all
policies.  Most policies describe rules for when to enable and disable
device features.  Configuring device features is a found in
many \ac{MDM} packages, but tracking what a user agrees to is not seen
in \ac{MDM} packages.  Only two of the five policies had
rules limiting access to networks, servers, or access points. This is
surprising as many \ac{MDM} tools can control how
devices and apps access networks.  Users have privacy preferences
about apps~\cite{lin_modeling_2014}, but not all companies try to
control what employees can install.  Curated app stores and
app blacklisting are common features to many \ac{MDM} programs; but not
all policies have rules about which apps to install.  All
policies talk about remotely wiping a device for security reasons
(as shown in~\autoref{sec:overview-of-five-byod-policies}). Most
\ac{MDM} tools offer this: they let admins
remotely erase devices~(\autoref{tab:mdm-capabilities}).

Two particular idioms occur in many policies: acknowledgments and
delegation.  So far MDM tools and research have
focused on implementing restrictions on apps and
devices~\cite{ibm_ibm_nodate,armando_formal_2014,martinelli_enhancing_2016}.
These controls are a vital aspect of BYOD policies and all
five of the policies we looked at had rules that described
restrictions~(\autoref{tab:common}).  Every policy also had
rules that required employees acknowledgments, however.  Only the
(configuration focused) SANS policy had more rules
that required restrictions than acknowledgments.  All the policies
had more rules featuring delegation relationships than
functionality restrictions.  Restricting device functionality is
and important: but other aspects of BYOD policies are also
worth attention.

\subsection{Delegation and Roles Within Policies}

Delegation is an important part of the policies.  Each of the policies
describes through rules how separate entities are responsible for
making some decisions.  These rules could be a delegation to an
employee's manager to authorize a decision (as in the NHS policy).  It
could be to technical staff to decide what apps are part of a standard
install (as in the sirens and SANS policies).

When translating the policies, the author of the policy is the primary
speaker of the policy's rules.  This is typically the company; except
in the \ac{HiMSS} case where it is the user (\autoref{tab:principals}).
All the policies describe multiple entities that might make statements
and delegate.

Some policies have more authorities than others
(\autoref{tab:principals}).  The NHS policy has various managers that
approve decisions for their staff.  There are groups that
make decisions for the clinical and business halves of the NHS.
If a clinical user wishes to use an app with a patient they must seek
approval from two policy groups, as well as their line manager.
Others make less use of different authorities.  In the Edinburgh
policy, the records-management office states how to configure a low or
high risk device.  There is no delegation to others to further specify
aspects of the policy.  Delegation of responsibilities is an important
part of BYOD policies.  MDM software seems largely to ignore it,
however.  These tools instead allow IT staff to set fixed policies and
push them to devices.  No further requesting of information is
typically needed or required.

When a policy decision requires input from a third-party, we use delegation.
For example, an employee's manager must authorize an app install.
The SecPAL \emph{can-say} statement is the basis for a delegation.
We can ask the HR department to state who is someone's manager.
When we delegate, we can add conditionals to the can-say
statement that enforces any relationship between the delegating and
delegated parties.

\begin{lstlisting}
'company' says 'hr-department' can-say
  Employee:E hasManager(Employee:M).
'company' says Manager can-say
  Employee canInstall(App:A)
  if Employee hasManager(Manager).
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Acknowledgment}

All the policies we looked at require their subjects be aware of and acknowledge
certain rules or policies. These include acknowledging the company may do
certain actions. Requiring subjects to acknowledge and agree to follow other
policies is interesting as these are not necessarily technical restrictions on
employee behavior. An administrator cannot configure a device so that a user is
aware of an ethical policy. Rather, they must trust that when the
user says they've read the policy, they actually did so.

In some cases this is used by companies to justify their actions.  A
user cannot complain about a company's actions if they were notified
in advance.  For example the NHS and \ac{HiMSS} policies state that
the organization will wipe devices remotely to protect confidential
information if a user loses their device.  Both policies also say that
employees would lose personal information if they had it on the device
and the company needed to erase it.  In the case of the \ac{HiMSS} policy, the user agrees not to
sue the company if this happens.

\begin{center}
  \noindent
  %\begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
    \begin{policyrule}{HiMSS}
      I agree to hold XYZ Health System harmless for any loss relating to the
      administration of PDA/Smartphone connectivity to XYZ Health System systems
      including, but not limited to, loss of personal information stored on a
      PDA/Smartphone due to data deletion done to protect sensitive information
      related to XYZ Health System, its patients, members or partners.
      \normalfont
      \begin{lstlisting}
'xyz-health-system' says
  'user' mustAcknowledge('data-loss-policy').
      \end{lstlisting}
    \end{policyrule}
  %\end{minipage}
  %\begin{minipage}{0.49\linewidth}
    \begin{policyrule}{NHS}
      Individuals who have personal data of any kind stored on a corporately
      issued mobile device must be aware that in the event of loss of the device
      the above data wipe will include removal of all personal data.
      \normalfont
      \begin{lstlisting}
'nhs-trust' says Staff:S can-say
  S hasAcknowledged('data-loss-policy').
'nhs-trust' says
  Staff:S mustAcknowledge('data-loss-policy').
      \end{lstlisting}
    \end{policyrule}
  %\end{minipage}
\end{center}

The SANS, NHS and the Sirens company policies use acknowledgments to link to
other sets of rules that employees should follow, such as the
\emph{acceptable-use} policy in the SANS example bellow. These policies are not
further specified and, in the case of an acceptable use policy, are hard to
enforce through other means. The SANS policy requires that all employees follow
an email security, acceptable use, and an eCommerce-security policy. The Sirens
policy expects an employee to use their devices ethically and abide by an
acceptable use policy.

\begin{policyrule}{SANS}
  Users MUST agree to the email security/acceptable use policy and eventually to the eCommerce security policy.
  \begin{lstlisting}
'company' says
  Employee:U mustAcknowledge('email-security').
'company' says
  Employee:U mustAcknowledge('acceptable-use').
'company' says
  Employee:U mustAcknowledge('ecommerce-security').
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{policyrule}
\begin{policyrule}{Sirens}
  The employee is expected to use his or her devices in an ethical manner at all times and adhere to the company's acceptable use policy.
  \begin{lstlisting}
'department' says
  Employee:E mustAcknowledge('acceptable-use').
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{policyrule}

We use acknowledgments when employees should be aware of (usually separate) rules.
The company may not have wish to enforce these separate rules automatically, however.
A company may have an ethical policy that says employees should not use devices for criminal purposes.
The company is not interested in, or capable of, defining what is criminal.
They trust their employees to make the right decision.
They trust their employees to know of the rules.

To write these in AppPAL, a policy author creates two rules.
  The first states their employees must have acknowledged the policy.
  The second delegates the acceptance of the policy to the employee themselves.
\begin{lstlisting}
'company' says Employee:E mustAcknowledge('policy').
'company' says Employee:E can-say
  E hasAcknowledged('policy').
\end{lstlisting}


\section{Enforcing a BYOD policy with AppPAL}

\begin{figure}

  \caption{Interactions in a company with BYOD security policies.}
  \label{fig:mdm-overview}
\end{figure}

Our work has, so far, looked at the BYOD policy contents. We have highlighted
the concerns and delegation relationships as they are not handled well by
existing \ac{MDM} tools. The policies also have rules that the \ac{MDM} tools do
manage well: configuring, provisioning and managing devices. The \ac{MDM} tools
fail, however, to give a means to control \emph{how} they to configure
themselves. Typically, an IT administrator configures them manually.

AppPAL exists as a tool for checking whether a policy is satisfied.
It is reasonable to ask what would a company have to do to
\emph{enforce} their mobile device policies. A company could have a
structure such as in \autoref{fig:mdm-overview}: the Chief Security
Officer sets the BYOD policy, which delegates to IT and HR to further
specify parts of the policy.  HR obliges employees to read all the
policies put out and follow them (by HR).  The IT department configure \ac{MDM} software on
employee's devices to ensure the devices meet their policies.

AppPAL offers a company the means to describe the policy precisely and check if
it satisfied. To enforce the policy the company would need to add actions on top
of these checks. If AppPAL checks a policy and finds a user must install an app
or disable a feature on their phone, then the company might want to configure
their \ac{MDM} software to do something to correct it. If AppPAL found an
employee had not met the obligation to sign a contract, then the company might
want to email a reminder to the employee.

AppPAL doesn't remove the need for \ac{MDM} software. Much of an \ac{MDM} tool
could be re-implemented as part of AppPAL: but this is an unnecessary
duplication of work. Rather, AppPAL should be used to configure and with other
existing tools. An \ac{MDM} package could enforce a password policy, and enable
remote wipe. Google's \emph{For Work} tools can enforce access control policies
for company's documents, as can Microsoft's Office Suite. The settings on an
Android app control what permissions an app can have. \ac{MDM} tools give a
means to control how a mobile device behaves, and what employees can do with a
device. Alone, however, they do not give enough to fully enforce a \ac{BYOD}
policy as all the \ac{BYOD} policies we looked at had more than just device
configuration.

AppPAL works as a glue between existing tools. It tells an administrator what
tools are used to check a policy. If the tool's configuration can be automated
through AppPAL (perhaps by enabling certain settings), then so much the better.
In this respect AppPAL is similar to a configuration language. Giving employees
a means to make AppPAL statements (such as a dialog box that says \emph{``to
acknowledge the following policy type your password.''}) lets us track what
people have done and make decisions on the basis of their actions. Configuring
and selecting the tools lets us pick which checks we enforce and when.
