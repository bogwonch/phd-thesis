\chapter{AppPAL}

AppPAL is a language for enforcing and analyzing mobile device policies.
AppPAL acts as a \emph{glue} between the high level policies users and companies have, and the tools used to enforce them.
For example a user may have an opinion about which apps they'll install:

\begin{quotation}
  ``I don't want to install any apps with in-app-purchases;
    though I don't mind installing a game with them---provided it's a good one.
  I also don't want to install any malware and I trust Google to warn me if I'm installing something dangerous.''
\end{quotation}

The user may enforce their preferences by hand-selecting apps in the store, but this is error prone---users could make mistakes.
The preferences are vague: what \emph{precisely} does the user mean by \emph{``provided it's a good one''}.
AppPAL gives us a formal language and decision process for getting the opinions specified as a policy and enforced by a computer.
The user's preferences could be written in AppPAL as:

\begin{lstlisting}
'user' says App isInstallable 
  if 'iap-rules' isMetBy App,
     App isNotMalware.

'user' says 'iap-rules' isMetBy App 
  if App isApp 
  where
     hasPermission(App, 'com.android.vending.BILLING') = false.

'user' says 'iap-rules' isMetBy App 
  if App hasCategory('game'),
     App isGood.

'user' says 'google' can-say App isNotMalware 
  if App isApp.
\end{lstlisting}

This makes some of the relationships more explicit.
To decide if an app is installable it must be shown that it meets the users \ac{iap} rules (two ways: either the app is either missing the \ac{iap} permission or it is a game that is good), and it is not malware (which the user delegates to Google to decide). 
The AppPAL translation also shows where the policy is lacking:
    there are no rules for deciding if something is good or not,
    similarly there are no rules for deciding an apps category.
The user could provide an explicit list of apps that are good and their categories; or they could delegate to a store or review service to tell them more about the apps they are selling.

\section{Evaluation}

AppPAL was designed by instantiating SecPAL~\cite{Becker:2006vh} for mobile device policies.
