\chapter{AppPAL}

We present AppPAL, an instantiation of Becker et al.â€™s
SecPAL\cite{becker_secpal:_2010} with constraints (statements
checkable using information external to the language such as the time
of day or static analysis tools) and predicates that allow us to
decide which apps to run or install. The language allows us to reason
about apps using statements from third parties. AppPAL allows us to
enforce the policies on a device. We can express trust relationships
amongst these parties and use constraints to do additional checks,
such as using security checks. This lets us enforce more complex
policies than existing tools such as Kirin qwhich are limited to
permissions checks. Policies can be enforced by the stores selling the
apps, on the devices installing apps or by third-parties providing app
vetting services.
Consider the following example:
  a user, Alice, may have rules she has to follow when using apps for work and her own policies when using apps at home in her private life.
Using AppPAL we can write policies for work and home, and decide which policy to enforce using a user's location, or the time of day:

\begin{lstlisting}
'alice' says App isRunnable
  if 'home-policy' isMetBy(App)
  where at('work') = false.
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
'alice' says App isRunnable
  if 'work-policy' isMetBy(App)
  where beforeHourOfDay('17') = true.
\end{lstlisting}

We can delegate policy specification to third parties or roles, and assign principals to roles:

\begin{lstlisting}
'alice' says 'it-department' can-say 'work-policy' isMetBy(App).
'alice' says 'alice' can-act-as 'it-department'.
\end{lstlisting}

We can write policies specifying which permissions an app must or must not have by its app store categorization.
For example, it would be okay allowing a photography app access to the camera, but not to allow access to location data if the user doesn't want their photos geotagged.

\begin{lstlisting}
'alice' says App isRunnable
  if 'permissions-policy' isMetBy(App).
'alice' says 'permissions-policy' isMetBy(App)
  if App isAnApp
  where
    category(App, 'Photography'),
    hasPermission(App, 'LOCATION') = false,
    hasPermission(App, 'CAMERA') = true.
\end{lstlisting}

AppPAL is implemented as a library for Android and Java.
The parser is implemented using ANTLR4.
AppPAL's syntax is inherited from SecPAL~\cite{becker_secpal:_2010} (shown in \autoref{fig:assertion}).

\section{Why SecPAL?}

For modelling and writing policies we want to start from a policy
language that supported several key features; namely:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Model decisions at separate locations.  Mobile ecosystems are
    inherently distributed, and decisions made by one device may not be
    the same as the decisions made by another device.  They may, however
    wish to share information.  By opting for a distributed language we
    can check the policies locally and make a decision based on that
    user's information rather than by deferring to an all-seeing policy
    enforcer.  This suits the problem better because individual devices
    and stores have to make decisions on their own and may not have access
    to all known information.

  \item Calling external functions that can obtain extra information
    about entities that may require special actions to fetch: for example
    an explicit ``okay'' from the user, or some metadata about an app like
    its version number.  If we don't allow the ability to fetch this
    information on-the-fly then it will have to be requested before
    checking the policy. 

    We also want to be able to use static analysis tools as part of
    our policies.  These tools can infer complex properties of apps, but
    the low-level details they check for needn't be expressable in our
    high level policies.  For example it is not necessary to encode how
    data moves over intents in AppPAL policies, but it is necessary to be
    able to say some app leaks information to another app.  A tool, such
    as FlowDroid can check for this, and there is no need to replicate the
    checking in AppPAL if we can simply call out to FlowDroid to give us a
    decision.

  \item Delegation.  We want to make a decision based on information from an
    external source.  This suggest that a \emph{can-say} mechanism is required
    that will allow us to express how trust is distributed.   Since the
    relationship between app stores and devices is one where a user delegates
    trust to the store and the device uses the external store to obtain the app
    this would hint that being able to express delegation will allow us to write
    more accurate policies.
\end{itemize}

Additionally we also wanted a language that was readable and easy to extend.
In this regard SecPAL is an excellent choice.  Languages such as RT lacked the support for constraints.  Cassandra could not easily be distributed. 

An alternative language could have been XACML.  XACML is a standardised policy language~\cite{oasis_extensibl:qe_2013} that can be extended to fit many scenarios.  It is an attribute based policy language, but can also role-based policies.  It has industrial support from \emph{Oracle}.

We chose SecPAL as the basis for the AppPAL language in part because of its highly readable syntax.
As well as being easy to read SecPAL has only three inference rules (\autoref{secpal:rules}) which makes it relatively easy to extend.
