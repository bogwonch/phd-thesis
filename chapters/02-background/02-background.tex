\section{Android and Mobile OSs}\label{android}

Android is a mobile operating system developed, primarily, by Google. It
is by far the most popular mobile operating system in use being
installed on around 83\% of all mobile handsets\footnote{\url{http://www.idc.com/prodserv/smartphone-os-market-share.jsp}}
with Apple's iOS being its only major competitor (Windows Phone,
Blackberry OS and other mobile operating systems account for only 3\% of
the marketshare in 2015).

Despite the dominance of Android its ecosystem is rather fragmented. As
shown in Figure \url{fig:android-versions}, in June 2016 only 10\% of
devices used the latest version of Android, with around 5\% of devices
still using a version released five years prior. The range of different
Android versions is often blamed on the device manufacturers being
unwilling to update their devices. Since the core of Android is open
source this has lead to third parties (such as CyanogenMod\footnote{\url{http://www.cyanogenmod.org}})
have started developing custom firmware for Android devices to allow
older devices to be upgraded independently of their manufacturers.

\end{figure*}

When building an Android device the manufacturers are also able to make
modifications to the Android firmware. This can be done to support any
custom hardware their device may have, add any additional software or
apps, or provide a custom look or theme to atheir device. Again this
creates more variety in the ecosystem, with few guarantees that any two
devices may contain similar features or hardware. In fact since the core
of the Android is the Linux kernel (albeit without the Linux Standard
Base\footnote{The \emph{Linux Standard Base} is a specification produced
  by the Linux foundation that describes what a stardard Linux system
  should contain and how it should be organised. Android uses its own
  system which differs most noticably by the different filesystem
  structures and the use of user IDs to separate apps rather than users.
  \url{http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/lsb.shtml}}, and with
additional patches) it can be ported to other architectures (such as X86
and MIPS), and used in other devices (such as set-top boxes and TVs,
watches, and cars) with relative ease.

To give developers a somewhat stable base to develop for Google
developed the \emph{Compatibility Test Suite} (CTS)\footnote{\url{https://source.android.com/compatibility/cts/index.html}},
and \emph{Compatibility Definition Document} (CDD)\footnote{\url{https://source.android.com/compatibility/android-cdd.html}}.
The CTS is a series of unit tests that check basic Android functionality
and behavior. The CDD is a document that describes what hardware an
Android device should have and how the device and it's software should
be built. If a device manufacturer wishes their device to run Google's
Play Store (the largest Android app marketplace), then they are required
to show they can pass the CTS and are in compliance with the CDD.

\section{App Stores}\label{app-stores}

The Play Store is Google's marketplace for apps. It contains a large
number of apps (around 2.2 million) uploaded by developers for users to
buy. To use the market places user's can login with a Google account
which is then used to sync purchases to their devices. Developers pay a
small fee (currently \$25) to submit an app to the store.

Google publish guidelines for developers wanting to publish
apps\footnote{\url{https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/}}.
These guidelines describe what content is acceptable, how developers may
publicise their app and request feedback as well as what kinds of
advertising is acceptable. Apps are inspected by Google before
publication; a somewhat secretive process that includes static analysis
as well as dynamic analysis using their \emph{Bouncer} tool
\cite{oberheide_dissecting_2012}.

Whilst the Play store may be the \emph{official} Android app marketplace
it is not the only way to install apps. Apps can be sideloaded
(installed) by asking the operating system to install the APK file (the
file format of an Android app) directly. Alternatively a third-party
store can be installed which will allow users to buy and sideload apps.

These third-party stores exist for a variety of reasons. Some such as
\emph{Qihoo 360 Mobile Assistant} and \emph{Baidu App Store} exist to cater to
the Chinese market, which has not traditionally had access to Google's services
for political reasons. Others such as the \emph{Amazon Appstore}\footnote{The
Amazon app store is also available to all devices, and aims to be similar to the
Google Play store, but with a more stringent review process.}, \emph{Sony Xperia
Apps} or \emph{Samsung Galaxy Apps} exist as curated app stores featuring apps
highlighting a particular device's features. There are app stores for open
source apps like \emph{F-Droid}. There are app stores for devices that can't (or
don't want to) pass the CTS and CDD like \emph{Yandex} and \emph{Aptoide}.

Each store comes with its own terms and conditions, some of which are
summarised in Table \url{tab:store-summary}. A user who does not wish to
be given updates might wish to use the Amazon store as it does not force
them to be installed. A developer who wishes to sell pornographic apps,
might want to use Yandex's store as many others prohibit them.

The only way to distinguish between these app stores is by
careful consideration of their advertising and terms and conditions.

\section{Why SecPAL?}
\todotext{This all needs rewriting and reorganising and is a mess.}

Languages such as RT lacked the support for constraints.  Cassandra could not easily be distributed. 
One alternative language could have been XACML.  
XACML is a standardised policy language~\cite{oasis_extensible_2013} that can be extended to fit many scenarios.  
It is an attribute based policy language, but can also describe role-based policies; and has industrial support from \emph{Oracle}.
XACML policies are expressed as sets of \emph{rules} that describe whether a specific action should be allowed or denied.
When making a \emph{request} if a rule's target matches the request then the appropriate action should be taken.
Rules are combined into policies and may contain many rules which can contradict each other if multiple ones match a given request.
To handle contraditions between rules a \emph{combining algorithm} may be used to decide how to proceed.
Typical algorithms include:
\begin{description}
  \item[Permit-overrides] where if a single rule gives a permit result then the request is permitted.
  \item[Deny-overrides] where if a single rule gives a deny result then then the request is denied.
  \item[First-applicable] where the rules are given an order of precedence and the first rule in the order that gives a result decides the outcome.
  \item[Only-one-applicable] where only one rule may match, and if there are multiple matches an error is returned.
\end{description}

XACML does not have a formal semantics, and is described using natural language documents~\cite{oasis_extensible_2013}. This has led to many papers where they attempt to retrofit a formal semantics onto XACML~\cite{masi_formalisation_2012}.  Ramli~\etal~use answer set programming as the basis for their translation for XACML 2.0~\cite{ramli_xacml_2012} and 3.0~\cite{ramli_logic_2014}.  They go on to use it to infer when XACML policies may be incomplete, contain conflicts on unreachable rules and policies~\cite{ramli_detecting_2015}. Other approaches have used CSP~\cite{bryans_reasoning_2005}.  In contrast SecPAL has a formal semantics and has been proven to be decidable~\cite{becker_secpal:_2010} which motivated the use of SecPAL over XACML.  Additionally whilst SecPAL was designed to support delegation relationships, XACML did not gain them until version 3.0~\cite{oasis_xacml_2010} which was not released when we did the initial survey.  Like the main specification, XACML's delegation semantics are poorly defined using natural language.

Another alternative was the Ponder policy specification language~\cite{damianou_ponder_2001}.
Like SecPAL, Ponder is designed for describing access control, authorization and delegation policies.
It supports constraints and additionally to SecPAL supports obligation policies; where if a policy is satisfied a program can be forced to be run.  It has a clean syntax, though 
I ultimately chose SecPAL as the basis for the AppPAL language over Ponder I felt it was more readable.
SecPAL's relative minimism over Ponder (SecPAL has only three inference rules as shown in \autoref{secpal:rules}) makes it easier to extend.
