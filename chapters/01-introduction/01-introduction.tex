\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{todo}
  This chapter should introduce:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Introduce the thesis.
  \item State the main contributions.
  \end{itemize}

  We should also ask \emph{what is the thesis of the thesis} which is a fiddly
  way of asking what are we trying to prove with this document?
\end{todo}
