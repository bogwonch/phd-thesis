	abstract = {Android's permission system is intended to inform users about the risks of installing applications. When a user installs an application, he or she has the opportunity to review the application's permission requests and cancel the installation if the permissions are excessive or objectionable. We examine whether the Android permission system is effective at warning users. In particular, we evaluate whether Android users pay attention to, understand, and act on permission information during installation. We performed two usability studies: an Internet survey of 308 Android users, and a laboratory study wherein we interviewed and observed 25 Android users. Study participants displayed low attention and comprehension rates: both the Internet survey and laboratory study found that 17\% of participants paid attention to permissions during installation, and only 3\% of Internet survey respondents could correctly answer all three permission comprehension questions. This indicates that current Android permission warnings do not help most users make correct security decisions. However, a notable minority of users demonstrated both awareness of permission warnings and reasonable rates of comprehension. We present recommendations for improving user attention and comprehension, as well as identify open challenges.},

	doi = {10.1109/SECPRI.1998.674819},
	abstract = {We describe an architecture for secure, independent, interworking services (Oasis). Each service is made responsible for the classification of its clients into named roles, using a formal logic to specify precise conditions for entering each role. A client becomes authenticated by presenting credentials to a service that enable the service to prove that the client conforms to its policy for entry to a particular role. During authentication a data structure is created that embodies the proof. An authenticated client is issued a role membership certificate (RMC) for its subsequent use with that service. An RMC is an encryption-protected capability which includes the role name, the identity of the principal to which it was issued and a reference to the issuing service. A proof rule of one service may refer to an authenticated user of another; that is, an RMC issued by one service may be required as a credential during authentication by another. A dynamic proof tree may thus be built which exhibits amongst other things the trust relationships between the services which the client has entered. The paper shows how a service may define a set of proof rules (Horn clauses) that specify who may use it and in what way. Delegation of rights may be expressed naturally within these rules. It goes on to present the design details of the system. The system is inherently decentralised and has a tuneable reaction to network or server failure which allows services to make appropriate decisions when authorization or revocation information is unavailable. A prototype system has been implemented and tested},

	abstract = {We present a declarative authorization language. Policies and credentials are expressed using predicates defined by logical clauses, in the style of constraint logic programming. Access requests are mapped to logical authorization queries, consisting of predicates and constraints combined by conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations. Access is granted if the query succeeds against the current database of clauses. Predicates ascribe rights to particular principals, with flexible support for delegation and revocation. At the discretion of the delegator, delegated rights can be further delegated, either to a fixed depth, or arbitrarily deeply. Our language strikes a careful balance between syntactic and semantic simplicity, policy expressiveness, and execution efficiency. The syntax is close to natural language, and the semantics consists of just three deduction rules. The language can express many common policy idioms using constraints, controlled delegation, recursive predicates, and negated queries. We describe an execution strategy based on translation to Datalog with Constraints, and table-based resolution. We show that this execution strategy is sound, complete, and always terminates, despite recursion and negation, as long as simple syntactic conditions are met.},

	abstract = {Conventional access control are suitable for regulating access to resources by known users.However,these models have often found to be inadequate for open and decentralized multi-centric systems where the user population is dynamic and the identity of all users are not known in advance.For such systems, credential based access control has been proposed. Credential based systems achieve access control by implementing a binary notion of trust.If a user is trusted by virtue of successful evaluation of its credentials it is allowed access, otherwise not. However,such credential based models have also been found to be lacking because of certain inherent drawbacks with the notion of credentials.In this work,we propose a trust based access control model called TrustBAC. It extends the conventional role based access control model with the notion of trust levels.Users are assigned to trust levels instead of roles based on a number of factors like user credentials,user behavior history,user recommendation etc. Trust levels are assigned to roles which are assigned to permissions as in role based access control.The TrustBAC model thus incorporates the advantages of both the role based access control model and credential based access control models.},

The increased number of applications results in a greater chance of installing Trojans and similar malware. In this paper, we propose the Kirin security service for Android, which performs lightweight certification of applications to mitigate malware at install time. Kirin certification uses security rules, which are templates designed to conservatively match undesirable properties in security configuration bundled with applications. We use a variant of security requirements engineering techniques to perform an in-depth security analysis of Android to produce a set of rules that match malware characteristics. In a sample of 311 of the most popular applications downloaded from the official Android Market, Kirin and our rules found 5 applications that implement dangerous functionality and therefore should be installed with extreme caution. Upon close inspection, another five applications asserted dangerous rights, but were within the scope of reasonable functional needs. These results indicate that security configuration bundled with Android applications provides practical means of detecting malware.},

Users must judge apps by the information shown to them by the store. Studies have found that most users do not pay attention to an apps permissions during installation [19] and most users do not understand how permissions relate to the capabilities of an app [30]. To address these problems and more, we present AppPAL: a machine-readable policy language for Android that describes precisely when apps are acceptable. AppPAL goes beyond existing policy enforcement tools, like Kirin [16], adding delegation relationships to allow a variety of authorities to contribute to a decision. AppPAL also acts as a âglueâ, allowing connection to a variety of local constraint checkers (e.g., static analysis tools, packager manager checks) to combine their results. As well as introducing AppPAL and some examples, we apply it to explore whether users follow certain intended policies in practice, finding privacy preferences and actual behaviour are not always aligned in the absence of a rigorous enforcement mechanism.},

Since the lack of visual security indicators for SSL/TLS usage and the inadequate use of SSL/TLS can be exploited to launch Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, an analysis of 13,500 popular free apps downloaded from Google's Play Market is presented.  We introduce MalloDroid, a tool to detect potential vulnerability against MITM attacks. Our analysis revealed that 1,074 (8.0\%) of the apps examined contain SSL/TLS code that is potentially vulnerable to MITM attacks. Various forms of SSL/TLS misuse were discovered during a further manual audit of 100 selected apps that allowed us to successfully launch MITM attacks against 41 apps and gather a large variety of sensitive data. Furthermore, an online survey was conducted to evaluate users' perceptions of certificate warnings and HTTPS visual security indicators in Android's browser, showing that half of the 754 participating users were not able to correctly judge whether their browser session was protected by SSL/TLS or not. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings and discuss several countermeasures with which these problems could be alleviated.},

Second, we designed new attribution mechanisms; a qualitative experiment suggested that our proposed mechanisms are intuitive to understand. Finally, we performed a laboratory experiment in which we simulated application misbehaviors to observe whether users equipped with our attribution mechanisms were able to identify the offending applications.

The measures are additive probabilities (used in the Bayesian theory), coherent lower (or upper) previsions, belief functions (used in the Dempster-Shafer theory) and possibility measures (fuzzy logic). Special emphasis is given to the theory of coherent lower previsions, in which upper and lower probabilities, expectations and conditional probabilities are constructed from initial assessments through a technique of natural extension. Mathematically, all the measures can be regarded as types of coherent lower or upper previsions, and this perspective gives some insight into the properties of belief functions and possibility measures. The measures are evaluated according to six criteria: clarity of interpretation; ability to model partial information and imprecise assessments, especially judgements expressed in natural language; rules for combining and updating uncertainty, and their justification; consistency of models and inferences; feasibility of assessment; and feasibility of computations. Each of the four measures seems to be useful in special kinds of problems, but only lower and upper previsions appear to be sufficiently general to model the most common types of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {We provide a detailed analysis of two largely unexplored aspects of the security decisions made by the Android operating system during the app installation process: update integrity and UID assignment. To inform our analysis, we collect a dataset of Android application metadata and extract features from these binaries to gain a better understanding of how developers interact with the security mechanisms invoked during installation. Using the dataset, we find empirical evidence that Android's current signing architecture does not encourage best security practices. We also find that limitations of Android's UID sharing method force developers to write custom code rather than rely on OS-level mechanisms for secure data transfer between apps. As a result of our analysis, we recommend incrementally deployable improvements, including a novel UID sharing mechanism with applicability to signature-level permissions. We additionally discuss mitigation options for a security bug in Google's Play store, which allows apps to transparently obtain more privileges than those requested in the manifest.},

To achieve this, smart spaces need to capture situational information so that they can detect changes in context and adapt themselves accordingly. However, without considering basic security issues ubiquitous computing environments could be rife with vulnerabilities. Ubiquitous computing environments impose new requirements on security. Security services, like authentication and access control, have to be non-intrusive, intelligent, and able to adapt to the rapidly changing contexts of the spaces. We present a ubiquitous security mechanism that integrates context-awareness with automated reasoning to perform authentication and access control in ubiquitous computing environments.},

This paper describes a collaborative black-box method, and an implementation called Carat, for diagnosing anomalies on mobile devices. A client app sends intermittent, coarse-grained measurements to a server, which correlates higher expected energy use with client properties like the running apps, device model, and operating system. The analysis quantifies the error and confidence associated with a diagnosis, suggests actions the user could take to improve battery life, and projects the amount of improvement. During a deployment to a community of more than 500,000 devices, Carat diagnosed thousands of energy anomalies in the wild. Carat detected all synthetically injected anomalies, produced no known instances of false positives, projected the battery impact of anomalies with 95\% accuracy, and, on average, increased a user's battery life by 11\% after 10 days (compared with 1.9\% for the control group).},

	abstract = {There is little information from independent sources in the public domain about mobile malware infection rates. The only previous independent estimate (0.0009\%) [11], was based on indirect measurements obtained from domain-name resolution traces. In this paper, we present the first independent study of malware infection rates and associated risk factors using data collected directly from over 55,000 Android devices. We find that the malware infection rates in Android devices estimated using two malware datasets (0.28\% and 0.26\%), though small, are significantly higher than the previous independent estimate. Based on the hypothesis that some application stores have a greater density of malicious applications and that advertising within applications and cross-promotional deals may act as infection vectors, we investigate whether the set of applications used on a device can serve as an indicator for infection of that device. Our analysis indicates that, while not an accurate indicator of infection by itself, the application set does serve as an inexpensive method for identifying the pool of devices on which more expensive monitoring and analysis mechanisms should be deployed. Using our two malware datasets we show that this indicator performs up to about five times better at identifying infected devices than the baseline of random checks. Such indicators can be used, for example, in the search for new or previously undetected malware. It is therefore a technique that can complement standard malware scanning. Our analysis also demonstrates a marginally significant difference in battery use between infected and clean devices.},

	abstract = {As computing technology becomes more pervasive and broadband services are
deployed into residential communities, new applications will emerge for the
home and community environment. These applications will assist people in a
variety of daily activities by enabling them to create, access, and
manipulate information about the residents and resources in their homes. In
a connected community, resources in the home and information about the
residents of the home will be remotely accessible to both residents and
guests, as well as to potentially malicious users. These new applications,
as well as their users and environment, pose new security challenges. The
challenges stem from two factors: the nature of the home itself---a private
space with a wealth of personal and sensitive information---and the limited
technical knowledge and capabilities of the home's residents.

We are addressing the problem of securing applications that will access and
control information resources in the home of the future. Specifically, we
are designing a security system based on a paradigm called Generalized
Role-Based Access Control (GRBAC). GRBAC is an extension of traditional
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It enhances traditional RBAC by
incorporating the notion of object roles and environment roles, with the
traditional notion of subject roles. These new types of roles allow one to
define rich, easy-to-understand security policies without having significant
technical knowledge of the underlying computer systems that implement those
policies. In this paper, we motivate the need for GRBAC, provide a
high-level description of it and demonstrate its usefulness and flexibility
via several example applications.},

	abstract = {We study the international standard XACML 3.0 for describing security access control policies in a compositional way. Our main contributions are (i) to derive a logic that precisely captures the intentions of the standard, (ii) to formally define a semantics for the XACML 3.0 component evaluation, and (iii) to define a semantics for the XACML 3.0 standard combining operators. To guard against modeling artefacts we provide an alternative lattice based way of characterizing the policy combining operators and we formally prove the equivalence of these approaches thereby increasing our faith in either one. We then discuss several ways of extending XACML: one direction is to extend XACML with new combining operators, and another direction is to incorporate the notion of conflict into XACML. We conclude by discussing the possibility of analysing XACML policies for gaps and conflicts.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new model for, or rather a new way of thinking about adaptive, risk-based access control. Our basic premise is that there is always inherent uncertainty and risk in access control decisions that is best addressed in an explicit way. We illustrate this concept by showing how the rationale of the well-known, Bell-Lapadula model based, multi-level security (MLS) access control model could be used to develop a risk-adaptive access control model. This new model is more like a fuzzy logic control system than a traditional access control system and hence the name "fuzzy MLS". The long version of this paper is published as an IBM Research Report.},

	abstract = {Access control to IT systems increasingly relies on the ability to compose policies. Hence there is benefit in any framework for policy composition that is intuitive, formal (and so âanalyzableâ and âimplementableâ), expressive, independent of specific application domains, and yet able to be extended to create domain-specific instances. Here we develop such a framework based on Belnap logic. An access-control policy is interpreted as a four-valued predicate that maps access requests to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified -- the four values of the Belnap bilattice. We define an expressive access-control policy language PBel, having composition operators based on the operators of Belnap logic. Natural orderings on policies are obtained by lifting the truth and information orderings of the Belnap bilattice. These orderings lead to a query language in which policy analyses, for example, conflict freedom, can be specified. Policy analysis is supported through a reduction of the validity of policy queries to the validity of propositional formulas on predicates over access requests. We evaluate our approach through firewall policy and RBAC policy examples, and discuss domain-specific and generic extensions of our policy language.},
