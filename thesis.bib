	abstract = {The advent of emerging technologies such as Web services, service-oriented architecture, and cloud computing has en-abled us to perform business services more efficiently and effectively. However, we still suffer from unintended secu-rity leakages by unauthorized services while providing more convenient services to Internet users through such a cutting-edge technological growth. Furthermore, designing and man-aging Web access control policies are often error-prone due to the lack of logical and formal foundation. In this paper, we attempt to introduce a logic-based policy management ap-proach for Web access control policies especially focusing on XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) policies, which have become the de facto standard for speci-fying and enforcing access control policies for various appli-cations and services in current Web-based computing tech-nologies. Our approach adopts Answer Set Programming (ASP) to formulate XACML that allows us to leverage the features of ASP solvers in performing various logical reason-ing and analysis tasks, such as verifying policy properties and detecting violation of separation of duty (SoD) constraints in role-based access control (RBAC).},

	abstract = {Discovery of frequent patterns has been studied in a variety of data mining settings. In its simplest form, known from association rule mining, the task is to discover all frequent itemsets, i.e., all combinations of items that are found in a sufficient number of examples. The fundamental task of association rule and frequent set discovery has been extended in various directions, allowing more useful patterns to be discovered with special purpose algorithms. We present WARMR, a general purpose inductive logic programming algorithm that addresses frequent query discovery: a very general DATALOG formulation of the frequent pattern discovery problem.The motivation for this novel approach is twofold. First, exploratory data mining is well supported: WARMR offers the flexibility required to experiment with standard and in particular novel settings not supported by special purpose algorithms. Also, application prototypes based on WARMR can be used as benchmarks in the comparison and evaluation of new special purpose algorithms. Second, the unified representation gives insight to the blurred picture of the frequent pattern discovery domain. Within the DATALOG formulation a number of dimensions appear that relink diverged settings.We demonstrate the frequent query approach and its use on two applications, one in alarm analysis, and one in a chemical toxicology domain.},

When a user installs an application, he or she has the opportunity to review the application's permission requests and cancel the installation if the permissions are excessive or objectionable. We examine whether the Android permission system is effective at warning users. In particular, we evaluate whether Android users pay attention to, understand, and act on permission information during installation. We performed two usability studies: an Internet survey of 308 Android users, and a laboratory study wherein we interviewed and observed 25 Android users. Study participants displayed low attention and comprehension rates: both the Internet survey and laboratory study found that 17\% of participants paid attention to permissions during installation, and only 3\% of Internet survey respondents could correctly answer all three permission comprehension questions. This indicates that current Android permission warnings do not help most users make correct security decisions. However, a notable minority of users demonstrated both awareness of permission warnings and reasonable rates of comprehension. We present recommendations for improving user attention and comprehension, as well as identify open challenges.},

In fact, employees are continually trying to incorporate their personal devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets, into the office to perform some of their work or simply to access the Internet with a device they trust or they are more familiar with. Unfortunately, several security issues may arise from all these external devices accessing the corporate network. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a framework that enforces on-the-fly instantiated policies inside organizations using trusted BYOD technologies. The proposed framework implements a role-based access control system based upon user identity and her current context. To this end, each user receives a specific policy from a server based upon the current role and context. The effective user identity is confirmed using OAuth 2.0, while the device integrity and policy enforcement is ensured by means of a on-device root-of-trust and an enforcer running on each device.},

	abstract = {We describe an architecture for secure, independent, interworking services (Oasis). Each service is made responsible for the classification of its clients into named roles, using a formal logic to specify precise conditions for entering each role. A client becomes authenticated by presenting credentials to a service that enable the service to prove that the client conforms to its policy for entry to a particular role. During authentication a data structure is created that embodies the proof. An authenticated client is issued a role membership certificate (RMC) for its subsequent use with that service. An RMC is an encryption-protected capability which includes the role name, the identity of the principal to which it was issued and a reference to the issuing service. A proof rule of one service may refer to an authenticated user of another; that is, an RMC issued by one service may be required as a credential during authentication by another. A dynamic proof tree may thus be built which exhibits amongst other things the trust relationships between the services which the client has entered. The paper shows how a service may define a set of proof rules (Horn clauses) that specify who may use it and in what way. Delegation of rights may be expressed naturally within these rules. It goes on to present the design details of the system. The system is inherently decentralised and has a tuneable reaction to network or server failure which allows services to make appropriate decisions when authorization or revocation information is unavailable.

The expressiveness of the permission set plays an important role in providing the right level of granularity in access control. In this work, we present a methodology for the empirical analysis of permission-based security models which makes novel use of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm of Kohonen (2001). While the proposed methodology may be applicable to a wide range of architectures, we analyze 1,100 Android applications as a case study. Our methodology is of independent interest for visualization of permission-based systems beyond our present Android-specific empirical analysis. We offer some discussion identifying potential points of improvement for the Android permission model attempting to increase expressiveness where needed without increasing the total number of permissions or overall complexity.},

Our work on real-world policies has shown that standard policy idioms such as role hierarchy or role delegation occur in practice in many subtle variants. A policy specification language should therefore be able to express this variety of features smoothly, rather than add them as specific features in an ad hoc way, as is the case in many existing languages. We present Cassandra, a role-based trust management system with an elegant and readable policy specification language based on Datalog with constraints. The expressiveness (and computational complexity) of the language can be adjusted by choosing an appropriate constraint domain. With just five special predicates, we can easily express a wide range of policies including role hierarchy, role delegation, separation of duties, cascading revocation, automatic credential discovery and trust negotiation. Cassandra has a formal semantics for query evaluation and for the access control enforcement engine. We use a goal-oriented distributed policy evaluation algorithm that is efficient and guarantees termination. Initial performance results for our prototype implementation have been promising.},

We built Stowaway, a tool that detects overprivilege in compiled Android applications. Stowaway determines the set of API calls that an application uses and then maps those API calls to permissions. We used automated testing tools on the Android API in order to build the permission map that is necessary for detecting overprivilege. We apply Stowaway to a set of 940 applications and find that about one-third are overprivileged. We investigate the causes of overprivilege and find evidence that developers are trying to follow least privilege but sometimes fail due to insufficient API documentation.},

We define the class of linearly decomposable unary constraint domains, prove that Datalog extended with constraints in any combination of such constraint domains is tractable, and show that permissions associated with structured resources fall into this class. We also present a concrete declarative TM language, RT C 1 , based on constraint Datalog, and use constraint Datalog to analyze another TM system, KeyNote, which turns out to be less expressive than RT C 1 in significant respects, yet less tractable in the worst case.

Also during the working time people prefer to stay in their consumer environment because that's their comfort zone. A collateral phenomenon is called BYOD (Bring Your Own Device), that means the employees use their own devices also during their working time. These changing of habits represent an opportunity and a challenge for the enterprises. The opportunity is related to two main aspects: the productivity increase and the costs reduction. In a BYOD scenario the end users would pay totally or partially the devices and would work independently from time and location. On the opposite side, the new scenario bring some risks that could be critical. The use of devices for both personal and working activities opens to new security threats to face for IT organization. Also, the direct comparison between public cloud services for personal use and company's IT services could be a frustrating user experience, that's because of the public cloud services are often almost more effective and usable than typical IT company's services. The aim of this work is presenting a brief survey about the emerging methods and models to approach the BYOD phenomenon from the security point of view.},

We show that the natural generalizations of the commutativity and ZYT-linearizability problems (respectively, the sequencability and base-case linearizability problems) are undecidable. Our constructions involve the simulation of context-free grammars using single-IDB programs that have a bounded number of initialisation rules. The constructions may be used to show that containment (or equivalence) is undecidable for such programs, even if the programs are linear, or if each program contains a single recursive rule. These results tighten those of [Shmu87] and [Abit89].},

This understanding will help inform the design of more secure smartphones that will enable users to safely and confidently benefit from the potential and convenience offered by mobile platforms. To gain insight into user perceptions of smartphone security and installation habits, we conduct a user study involving 60 smartphone users. First, we interview users about their willingness to perform certain tasks on their smartphones to test the hypothesis that people currently avoid using their phones due to privacy and security concerns. Second, we analyze why and how they select applications, which provides information about how users decide to trust applications. Based on our findings, we present recommendations and opportunities for services that will help users safely and confidently use mobile applications and platforms.},

	abstract = {We present a declarative authorization language. Policies and credentials are expressed using predicates defined by logical clauses, in the style of constraint logic programming. Access requests are mapped to logical authorization queries, consisting of predicates and constraints combined by conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations. Access is granted if the query succeeds against the current database of clauses. Predicates ascribe rights to particular principals, with flexible support for delegation and revocation. At the discretion of the delegator, delegated rights can be further delegated, either to a fixed depth, or arbitrarily deeply. Our language strikes a careful balance between syntactic and semantic simplicity, policy expressiveness, and execution efficiency. The syntax is close to natural language, and the semantics consists of just three deduction rules. The language can express many common policy idioms using constraints, controlled delegation, recursive predicates, and negated queries. We describe an execution strategy based on translation to Datalog with Constraints, and table-based resolution. We show that this execution strategy is sound, complete, and always terminates, despite recursion and negation, as long as simple syntactic conditions are met.},

Credential based systems achieve access control by implementing a binary notion of trust.If a user is trusted by virtue of successful evaluation of its credentials it is allowed access, otherwise not. However,such credential based models have also been found to be lacking because of certain inherent drawbacks with the notion of credentials.In this work,we propose a trust based access control model called TrustBAC. It extends the conventional role based access control model with the notion of trust levels.Users are assigned to trust levels instead of roles based on a number of factors like user credentials,user behavior history,user recommendation etc. Trust levels are assigned to roles which are assigned to permissions as in role based access control.The TrustBAC model thus incorporates the advantages of both the role based access control model and credential based access control models.},

However, recent studies reveal that many apps, even benign ones, could leak sensitive information without user awareness or consent. Previous solutions either require to modify the Android framework thus significantly impairing their practical deployment, or could be easily defeated by malicious apps using a native library. In this paper, we propose AppCage, a system that thoroughly confines the run-time behavior of third-party Android apps without requiring framework modifications or root privilege. AppCage leverages two complimentary user-level sandboxes to interpose and regulate an app's access to sensitive APIs. Specifically, dex sandbox hooks into the app's Dalvik virtual machine instance and redirects each sensitive framework API to a proxy which strictly enforces the user-defined policies, and native sandbox leverages software fault isolation to prevent the app's native libraries from directly accessing the protected APIs or subverting the dex sandbox. We have implemented a prototype of AppCage. Our evaluation shows that AppCage can successfully detect and block attempts to leak private information by third-party apps, and the performance overhead caused by AppCage is negligible for apps without native libraries and minor for apps with them.},

DL inferencing is computationally intractable and highly impractical to implement. We introduce a new version of Delegation Logic that remedies these difficulties. To achieve this, we impose a syntactic restriction and redefine the semantics somewhat. We show that, for this revised version of DL, inferencing is computationally tractable under the same commonly met restrictions for which Ordinary Logic Programs (OLP) inferencing is tractable (e.g., Datalog and bounded number of logical variables per rule). We give an implementation architecture for this version of DL; it uses a delegation compiler from DL to OLP and can modularly exploit a variety of existing OLP inference engines. As proof of concept, we have implemented a large expressive subset of this version of DL, using this architecture},

Kirin certification uses security rules, which are templates designed to conservatively match undesirable properties in security configuration bundled with applications. We use a variant of security requirements engineering techniques to perform an in-depth security analysis of Android to produce a set of rules that match malware characteristics. In a sample of 311 of the most popular applications downloaded from the official Android Market, Kirin and our rules found 5 applications that implement dangerous functionality and therefore should be installed with extreme caution. Upon close inspection, another five applications asserted dangerous rights, but were within the scope of reasonable functional needs.

What has been missing is a formal semantics - in particular, one that would capture the inherently dynamic nature of trust management, where access decisions are based on the local policy in conjunction with varying sets of dynamically submitted credentials. The goal of this paper is to rest trust management on a solid formal foundation. To this end, we present a model theory that is based on Kripke structures for counterfactual logic. The semantics enjoys compositionality and full abstraction with respect to a natural notion of observational equivalence between trust management policies. Furthermore, we present a corresponding Hilbert-style axiomatization that is expressive enough for reasoning about a system's observables on the object level. We describe an implementation of a mechanization of the proof theory, which can be used to prove non-trivial meta-theorems about trust management systems, as well as analyze probing attacks on such systems. Our benchmark results show that this logic-based approach performs significantly better than the only previously available, ad-hoc analysis method for probing attacks.},

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to trust management, based on a simple language for specifying trusted actions and trust relationships. It also describes a prototype implementation of a new trust management system, called PolicyMaker, that will facilitate the development of security features in a wide range of network services},

	abstract = {Over the last 15 years, many policy languages have been developed for specifying policies and credentials under the trust management paradigm. What has been missing is a formal semantics - in particular, one that would capture the inherently dynamic nature of trust management, where access decisions are based on the local policy in conjunction with varying sets of dynamically submitted credentials. The goal of this paper is to rest trust management on a solid formal foundation. To this end, we present a model theory that is based on Kripke structures for counterfactual logic. The semantics enjoys compositionality and full abstraction with respect to a natural notion of observational equivalence between trust management policies. Furthermore, we present a corresponding Hilbert-style axiomatization that is expressive enough for reasoning about a system's observables on the object level. We describe an implementation of a mechanization of the proof theory, which can be used to prove non-trivial meta-theorems about trust management systems, as well as analyze probing attacks on such systems. Our benchmark results show that this logic-based approach performs significantly better than the only previously available, ad-hoc analysis method for probing attacks.},

The emergence of new technologies and features of mobile devices makes them integral parts of every aspect of daily business activities. Also, mobile networks are now well integrated with the Internet (e.g. 3G, 4G and LTE technologies), therefore, in BYOD, the personal devices (i.e. mobile devices) can be used to increase employees' satisfaction and reduce an organization's device costs. Mobile devices are not well protected compared to computer and computer networks and users pay less attention to security updates and solutions. As a result, mobile security has become a crucial issue in BYOD as employees use their own mobile devices to access an organization's data and systems. Therefore, in this paper we present an overview of the current state of BYOD security and we discuss some future challenges in this area.},

Studies have found that most users do not pay attention to an apps permissions during installation [19] and most users do not understand how permissions relate to the capabilities of an app [30]. To address these problems and more, we present AppPAL: a machine-readable policy language for Android that describes precisely when apps are acceptable. AppPAL goes beyond existing policy enforcement tools, like Kirin [16], adding delegation relationships to allow a variety of authorities to contribute to a decision. AppPAL also acts as a “glue”, allowing connection to a variety of local constraint checkers (e.g., static analysis tools, packager manager checks) to combine their results. As well as introducing AppPAL and some examples, we apply it to explore whether users follow certain intended policies in practice, finding privacy preferences and actual behaviour are not always aligned in the absence of a rigorous enforcement mechanism.},

	abstract = {In dynamic and uncertain environments such as healthcare, where the needs of security and information availability are difficult to balance, an access control approach based on a static policy will be suboptimal regardless of how comprehensive it is. The uncertainty stems from the unpredictability of users' operational needs as well as their private incentives to misuse permissions. In Role Based Access Control (RBAC), a user's legitimate access request may be denied because its need has not been anticipated by the security administrator. Alternatively, even when the policy is correctly specified an authorised user may accidentally or intentionally misuse the granted permission. This paper introduces a novel approach to access control under uncertainty and presents it in the context of RBAC. By taking insights from the field of economics, in particular the insurance literature, we propose a formal model where the value of resources are explicitly defined and an RBAC policy (entailing those predictable access needs) is only used as a reference point to determine the price each user has to pay for access, as opposed to representing hard and fast rules that are always rigidly applied.},

We retrofit the Android operating system to implement these two controls for use with unmodified applications. A key challenge of imposing shadowing and exfiltration blocking on existing applications is that these controls could cause side effects that interfere with user-desired functionality. To measure the impact of side effects, we develop an automated testing methodology that records screenshots of application executions both with and without privacy controls, then automatically highlights the visual differences between the different executions. We evaluate our privacy controls on 50 applications from the Android Market, selected from those that were both popular and permission-hungry. We find that our privacy controls can successfully reduce the effective permissions of the application without causing side effects for 66\% of the tested applications. The remaining 34\% of applications implemented user-desired functionality that required violating the privacy requirements our controls were designed to enforce; there was an unavoidable choice between privacy and user-desired functionality.},

We then consider axiomatizing these logics. In general, it can be shown that no complete axiomatization is possible. We provide axiom systems that are sound and complete in cases where a complete axiomatization is possible, showing that they do allow us to capture a great deal of interesting reasoning about probability.},

Consumer IT tools, in form of tablets, smartphones, or social media, are entering organizations and are changing the way employees use technology for work. In this article, the authors decipher the term IT consumerization in more detail by providing a framework that illustrates the various perspectives of the phenomenon. They then apply the various perspectives in order to propose an IT consumerization framework that juxtaposes consumer IT with enterprise IT in its ability to lead to individual IT innovation behaviors. Using data from 486 European employees that work for large-sized companies, they are able to infer that consumer IT and the permission to use privately owned IT exert positive effects on employees’ innovation behaviors. An examination of the various perspectives supports the assumption of science and practice that BYOD strategies and the diffusion of consumer IT within organizations are beneficial for innovation. The results provide a first step in theorizing about the innovative power of IT consumerization.},

	abstract = {Existing authorization mechanisms fail to provide powerful and robust tools for handling security at the scale necessary for today’s Internet. These mechanisms are coming under increasing strain from the development and deployment of systems that increase the programmability of the Internet. Moreover, this “increased flexibility through programmability” trend seems to be accelerating with the advent of proposals such as Active Networking and Mobile Agents. The trust-management approach to distributed-system security was developed as an answer to the inadequacy of traditional authorization mechanisms. Trust-management engines avoid the need to resolve “identities” in an authorization decision. Instead, they express privileges and restrictions in a programming language. This allows for increased flexibility and expressibility, as well as standardization of modern, scalable security mechanisms. Further advantages of the trust-management approach include proofs that requested transactions comply with local policies and system architectures that encourage developers and administrators to consider an application’s security policy carefully and specify it explicitly. In this paper, we examine existing authorization mechanisms and their inadequacies. We introduce the concept of trust management, explain its basic principles, and describe some existing trust-management engines, including PolicyMaker and KeyNote. We also report on our experience using trust-management engines in several distributed-system applications.},

	abstract = {Many Android apps have a legitimate need to communicate over the Internet and are then responsible for protecting potentially sensitive data during transit. This paper seeks to better understand the potential security threats posed by benign Android apps that use the SSL/TLS protocols to protect data they transmit. Since the lack of visual security indicators for SSL/TLS usage and the inadequate use of SSL/TLS can be exploited to launch Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, an analysis of 13,500 popular free apps downloaded from Google's Play Market is presented.  We introduce MalloDroid, a tool to detect potential vulnerability against MITM attacks. Our analysis revealed that 1,074 (8.0\%) of the apps examined contain SSL/TLS code that is potentially vulnerable to MITM attacks. Various forms of SSL/TLS misuse were discovered during a further manual audit of 100 selected apps that allowed us to successfully launch MITM attacks against 41 apps and gather a large variety of sensitive data. Furthermore, an online survey was conducted to evaluate users' perceptions of certificate warnings and HTTPS visual security indicators in Android's browser, showing that half of the 754 participating users were not able to correctly judge whether their browser session was protected by SSL/TLS or not. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings and discuss several countermeasures with which these problems could be alleviated.},

We define the class of linearly decomposable unary constraint domains, prove that Datalog extended with constraints in any combination of such constraint domains is tractable, and show that permissions associated with structured resources fall into this class. We also present a concrete declarative TM language, RT C 1 , based on constraint Datalog, and use constraint Datalog to analyze another TM system, KeyNote, which turns out to be less expressive than RT C 1 in significant respects, yet less tractable in the worst case. Although constraint Datalog has been studied in the context of constraint databases, TM applications involve different kinds of constraint domains and have different computational complexity requirements.},

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we perform static analysis on the executables to extract their function calls in Android environment using the command readelf.

Second, we designed new attribution mechanisms; a qualitative experiment suggested that our proposed mechanisms are intuitive to understand. Finally, we performed a laboratory experiment in which we simulated application misbehaviors to observe whether users equipped with our attribution mechanisms were able to identify the offending applications. Our results show that, for users who notice application misbehaviors, these attribution mechanisms are significantly more effective than the status quo.},

Static detection is one typical method to analyze malicious code. However, existing single static detection method can introduce high false alarm rate and is only appropriate for a limited scope. In this paper, we propose an integrated static detection framework, which consists of four layers of filtering mechanisms, that is, the message digest (MD5) values, the combination of malicious permissions, the dangerous permissions, and the dangerous intention, respectively. An intuitive threat-degree model is proposed especially on dangerous permissions detection. Furthermore, we implement a prototype system ASE and validate its feasibility, performance and scalability. A comprehensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework has obvious advantages especially in efficiency, granularity, layers, and correctness.},

	abstract = {Bytecode rewriting on Android applications has been widely adopted to implement fine-grained access control. It endows more flexibility and convenience without modifying the Android platform. Bytecode rewriting uses static analysis to identify the usage of security-sensitive API methods, before it instruments the bytecode to control the access to these API calls. Due to the significance of this technique, the effectiveness of its performance in providing fine-grained access control is crucial. We have provided a systematic evaluation to assess the effectiveness of API-level access control using bytecode rewriting on Android Operating System. In our evaluation, we have identified a number of potential attacks targeted at incomplete implementations of bytecode rewriting on Android OS, which can be applied to bypass access control imposed by bytecode rewriter. These attacks can either bypass the API-level access control or make such access control difficult to implement, exposing weak links in the bytecode rewriting process. Recommendations on engineering secure bytecode rewriting tools are presented based on the identified attacks. This work is the first systematic study on the effectiveness of using bytecode rewriting for API-level access control.},

We use the theory to explain many existing and proposed security mechanisms. In particular, we describe the system we have built.

We show that the natural generalizations of the commutativity and ZYT-linearizability problems (respectively, the sequencability and base-case linearizability problems) are undecidable. Our constructions involve the simulation of context-free grammars using single-IDB programs that have a bounded number of initialisation rules. The constructions may be used to show that containment (or equivalence) is undecidable for such programs, even if the programs are linear, or if each program contains a single recursive rule.

However, recent studies also reveal the disturbing fact that users’ personal information is put at risk by (rogue) smartphone applications. Existing solutions exhibit limitations in their capabilities in taming these privacy-violating smartphone applications. In this paper, we argue for the need of a new privacy mode in smartphones. The privacy mode can empower users to flexibly control in a fine-grained manner what kinds of personal information will be accessible to an application. Also, the granted access can be dynamically adjusted at runtime in a fine-grained manner to better suit a user’s needs in various scenarios (e.g., in a different time or location). We have developed a system called TISSA that implements such a privacy mode on Android. The evaluation with more than a dozen of information-leaking Android applications demonstrates its effectiveness and practicality. Furthermore, our evaluation shows that TISSA introduces negligible performance overhead.},

The measures are additive probabilities (used in the Bayesian theory), coherent lower (or upper) previsions, belief functions (used in the Dempster-Shafer theory) and possibility measures (fuzzy logic). Special emphasis is given to the theory of coherent lower previsions, in which upper and lower probabilities, expectations and conditional probabilities are constructed from initial assessments through a technique of natural extension. Mathematically, all the measures can be regarded as types of coherent lower or upper previsions, and this perspective gives some insight into the properties of belief functions and possibility measures. The measures are evaluated according to six criteria: clarity of interpretation; ability to model partial information and imprecise assessments, especially judgements expressed in natural language; rules for combining and updating uncertainty, and their justification; consistency of models and inferences; feasibility of assessment; and feasibility of computations. Each of the four measures seems to be useful in special kinds of problems, but only lower and upper previsions appear to be sufficiently general to model the most common types of uncertainty.},

To inform our analysis, we collect a dataset of Android application metadata and extract features from these binaries to gain a better understanding of how developers interact with the security mechanisms invoked during installation. Using the dataset, we find empirical evidence that Android's current signing architecture does not encourage best security practices. We also find that limitations of Android's UID sharing method force developers to write custom code rather than rely on OS-level mechanisms for secure data transfer between apps. As a result of our analysis, we recommend incrementally deployable improvements, including a novel UID sharing mechanism with applicability to signature-level permissions. We additionally discuss mitigation options for a security bug in Google's Play store, which allows apps to transparently obtain more privileges than those requested in the manifest.},

	abstract = {In dynamic and uncertain environments such as healthcare, where the needs of security and information availability are difficult to balance, an access control approach based on a static policy will be suboptimal regardless of how comprehensive it is. The uncertainty stems from the unpredictability of users' operational needs as well as their private incentives to misuse permissions. In Role Based Access Control (RBAC), a user's legitimate access request may be denied because its need has not been anticipated by the security administrator. Alternatively, even when the policy is correctly specified an authorised user may accidentally or intentionally misuse the granted permission. This paper introduces a novel approach to access control under uncertainty and presents it in the context of RBAC. By taking insights from the field of economics, in particular the insurance literature, we propose a formal model where the value of resources are explicitly defined and an RBAC policy (entailing those predictable access needs) is only used as a reference point to determine the price each user has to pay for access, as opposed to representing hard and fast rules that are always rigidly applied.},

	abstract = {Enabling the shared care paradigm, centralised or even decentralised electronic health record (EHR) systems increasingly become core applications in hospital information systems and health networks. For realising multipurpose use and reuse as well as inter-operability at knowledge level, EHR have to meet special architectural requirements. The component-oriented and model-based architecture should meet international standards. Especially in extended health networks realising inter-organisational communication and co-operation, authorisation cannot be organised at user level anymore. Therefore, models, methods and tools must be established to allow formal and structured policy definition, policy agreements, role definition, authorisation and access control.

Based on the author’s international engagement in EHR architecture and security standards referring to the revision of CEN ENV 13606, the GEHR/open EHR approach, HL7 and CORBA, models for health-specific and EHR-related roles, for authorisation management and access control have been developed. The basic concept is the separation of structural roles defining organisational entity-to-entity relationships and enabling specific acts on the one hand, and functional roles bound to specific activities and realising rights and duties on the other hand. Aggregation of organisational, functional, informational and technological components follows specific rules. Using UML and XML, the principles as well as some examples for analysis, design, implementation and maintenance of policy and authorisation management as well as access control have been practically implemented.},

	abstract = {Policies are rules that govern the choices in behaviour of a system. Security policies define what actions are permitted or not permitted, for what or for whom, and under what conditions. Management policies define what actions need to be carried out when specific events occur within a system or what resources must be allocated under specific conditions. There is considerable interest in the use of policies for the security and management of large-scale networks and distributed services. Existing policy work has focussed on specification, information models and application-specific policy enforcement. We address the important goal of providing a general-purpose deployment model for policies that is independent of the underlying policy enforcement mechanisms and can be employed in mixed policy environments. In this paper, we present a deployment model that is object-oriented and addresses the instantiation, distribution and enabling of policies as well as the disabling, unloading and deletion of policies. The model defines objects for policies, for domains, and for the policy enforcement agent and outlines the interactions needed between them. The model also caters for changes in the memberships of domains since such changes also effect policy enforcement. The model forms part of the run-time support for Ponder; a new policy language that combines structuring ideas from object-oriented languages with a common set of policy basic types},

The topic of inquiry was “The Anatomy of Fish”. Data collection included pre- and post-domain tests, self-reported questionnaire, student artifacts, class observations and field notes. Content analysis and a student artifact tracing approach were adopted in the data analysis to examine and trace students' knowledge advancement. The research findings show that the students advanced their understanding of the anatomy of fish well beyond what was available in the textbook and they developed positive attitude toward seamless science inquiry supported by their own mobile devices.},

	abstract = {Emerging electronic commerce services that use public-key cryptography on a mass-market scale require sophisticated mechanisms for managing trust. For example, any service that receives a signed request for action is forced to answer the central question “Is the key used to sign this request authorized to take this action?” In some services, this question reduces to “Does this key belong to this person?” In others, the authorization question is more complicated, and resolving it requires techniques for formulating security policies and security credentials, determining whether particular sets of credentials satisfy the relevant policies, and deferring trust to third parties. Blaze, Feigenbaum, and Lacy [1] identified this trust management problem as a distinct and important component of network services and described a general tool for addressing it, the PolicyMaker trust management system.At the heart of a trust management system is an algorithm for compliance checking. The inputs to the compliance checker are a request, a policy, and a set of credentials. The compliance checker returns yes or no, depending on whether the credentials constitute a proof that the request complies with the policy. Thus a central challenge in trust management is to find an appropriate notion of “proof” and an efficient algorithm for checking proofs of compliance.In this paper, we present the notion of proof that is used in the current version of the PolicyMaker trust management system. We show that this notion of proof leads to a compliance-checking problem that is undecidable in its most general form and is NP-hard even if restricted in several natural ways. We identify a special case of the problem that is solvable in polynomial time and is widely applicable. The algorithm that we give for this special case has been implemented and is used in the current version of the PolicyMaker system.},

	abstract = {The popularity and adoption of smart phones has greatly stimulated the spread of mobile malware, especially on the popular platforms such as Android. In light of their rapid growth, there is a pressing need to develop effective solutions. However, our defense capability is largely constrained by the limited understanding of these emerging mobile malware and the lack of timely access to related samples. In this paper, we focus on the Android platform and aim to systematize or characterize existing Android malware. Particularly, with more than one year effort, we have managed to collect more than 1,200 malware samples that cover the majority of existing Android malware families, ranging from their debut in August 2010 to recent ones in October 2011. In addition, we systematically characterize them from various aspects, including their installation methods, activation mechanisms as well as the nature of carried malicious payloads. The characterization and a subsequent evolution-based study of representative families reveal that they are evolving rapidly to circumvent the detection from existing mobile anti-virus software. Based on the evaluation with four representative mobile security software, our experiments show that the best case detects 79.6\% of them while the worst case detects only 20.2\% in our dataset. These results clearly call for the need to better develop next-generation anti-mobile-malware solutions.},

	abstract = {Android is the first mass-produced consumer-market open source mobile platform that allows developers to easily create applications and users to readily install them. However, giving users the ability to install third-party applications poses serious security concerns. While the existing security mechanism in Android allows a mobile phone user to see which resources an application requires, she has no choice but to allow access to all the requested permissions if she wishes to use the applications. There is no way of granting some permissions and denying others. Moreover, there is no way of restricting the usage of resources based on runtime constraints such as the location of the device or the number of times a resource has been previously used. In this paper, we present Apex -- a policy enforcement framework for Android that allows a user to selectively grant permissions to applications as well as impose constraints on the usage of resources. We also describe an extended package installer that allows the user to set these constraints through an easy-to-use interface. Our enforcement framework is implemented through a minimal change to the existing Android code base and is backward compatible with the current security mechanism.},

To achieve this, smart spaces need to capture situational information so that they can detect changes in context and adapt themselves accordingly. However, without considering basic security issues ubiquitous computing environments could be rife with vulnerabilities. Ubiquitous computing environments impose new requirements on security. Security services, like authentication and access control, have to be non-intrusive, intelligent, and able to adapt to the rapidly changing contexts of the spaces. We present a ubiquitous security mechanism that integrates context-awareness with automated reasoning to perform authentication and access control in ubiquitous computing environments.},

	abstract = {The Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) paradigm, where the employees of a company install an application on their mobile devices to access company privileged information, is becoming very popular in the business environment. In order to perform their tasks, BYOD applications typically require a large set of rights which, in Android mobile devices, must be statically granted in order to have the application installed. However, this access control model is too coarse grained for the BYOD scenario, because employees would like to have a finer control on the rights granted to such applications, for instance to protect their privacy when they are not on duty. To address this issue, we propose to enhance the Android permission system through a Usage Control-based framework enabling employees to write policies which are continuously enforced while BYOD applications are running. This framework acts as a dynamic permission manager, where usage control policies grants, revokes and restores permissions to running applications on the base of mutable attributes describing the current context. Context is observed by using Android device standard APIs to monitor attributes such as mobile device location, WiFi status, battery level, current date and time, and so on. External trusted attribute providers can also be exploited.},

None of the participating hospitals had a dedicated information governance policy for bring your own device. Data were collected by 17 investigators for 392 individual theatre lists, capturing 14 148 individual data points, 12 852 (91\%) of which were transmitted to a central database on the day of collection without any loss of data. BYOD technology enabled accurate collection of a large volume of secure data across multiple NHS organisations over a short period of time.

As a matter of fact, today smartphones and tablets have remarkable hardware profiles and a cornucopia of applications. Yet, the security mechanisms offered by most popular mobile operating systems offer only limited protection to the threats posed by malicious applications that may be inadvertently installed by the users and therefore they do not meet the security standards required in corporate environments. In this paper we propose a security framework for mobile devices that ensures that only applications complying with the organization security policy can be installed. This is done by inferring behavioral models from applications and by validating them against the security policy.

This paper describes a collaborative black-box method, and an implementation called Carat, for diagnosing anomalies on mobile devices. A client app sends intermittent, coarse-grained measurements to a server, which correlates higher expected energy use with client properties like the running apps, device model, and operating system. The analysis quantifies the error and confidence associated with a diagnosis, suggests actions the user could take to improve battery life, and projects the amount of improvement. During a deployment to a community of more than 500,000 devices, Carat diagnosed thousands of energy anomalies in the wild. Carat detected all synthetically injected anomalies, produced no known instances of false positives, projected the battery impact of anomalies with 95\% accuracy, and, on average, increased a user's battery life by 11\% after 10 days (compared with 1.9\% for the control group).},

	abstract = {There is little information from independent sources in the public domain about mobile malware infection rates. The only previous independent estimate (0.0009\%) [11], was based on indirect measurements obtained from domain-name resolution traces. In this paper, we present the first independent study of malware infection rates and associated risk factors using data collected directly from over 55,000 Android devices. We find that the malware infection rates in Android devices estimated using two malware datasets (0.28\% and 0.26\%), though small, are significantly higher than the previous independent estimate. Based on the hypothesis that some application stores have a greater density of malicious applications and that advertising within applications and cross-promotional deals may act as infection vectors, we investigate whether the set of applications used on a device can serve as an indicator for infection of that device. Our analysis indicates that, while not an accurate indicator of infection by itself, the application set does serve as an inexpensive method for identifying the pool of devices on which more expensive monitoring and analysis mechanisms should be deployed. Using our two malware datasets we show that this indicator performs up to about five times better at identifying infected devices than the baseline of random checks. Such indicators can be used, for example, in the search for new or previously undetected malware. It is therefore a technique that can complement standard malware scanning. Our analysis also demonstrates a marginally significant difference in battery use between infected and clean devices.},

	abstract = {Grid access control policy languages today are generally one of two extremes: either extremely simplistic, or overly complex and challenging for even security experts to use. In this paper, we explicitly identify requirements for an access control policy language for grid data and then consider six specific data access use-cases that have been problematic in today's grids: attribute-based access, role-based access, "role-deny" access, impersonation-based access, delegation-based access, and capability-based access. We evaluate the security policy assertion language (SecPAL) against those requirements, specifically in the context of these six use-cases involving GridFTP.NET. We find that while some of these six use-cases are individually possible via existing Grid authorization systems, we believe that SecPAL uniquely offers a single approach that meets the requirements of a grid access control policy language, thereby creating support for a wide range of expanded scenarios for grid data access.},

An axiomatizable class of similar algebras, such as the class of groups, is closed under direct union when each of its axioms is invariant. In this paper we shall determine a wide class of invariant sentences. We shall also be concerned with determining sentences which are true of a direct union provided they are true of some factor algebra. In the case where all the factor algebras are the same, a further result is obtained. In §2 it will be shown that these criteria are the only ones of their kind. Lemma 7 below may be of some independent interest.We adopt the terminology and notation of McKinsey with the exception that the sign · will be used for conjunction. Expressions of the form ∼∊, where ∊ is an equation, will be called inequalities. In accordance with the analogy between conjunction and disjunction with product and sum respectively, we shall call α1, …, αn the terms of the disjunctionand the factors of the conjunctionEvery closed sentence is equivalent to a sentence in prenez normal form,where x1, …, xm distinct individual variables, Q1, …, Qm are quantifiers, and the matrix S is an open sentence in which each of the variables x1, …, xm actually occurs.

	abstract = {Many prior trust management frameworks provide authorization logics for specifying policies based on distributed trust. However, to implement a security protocol using these frameworks, one usually resorts to a general-purpose programming language. To reason about the security of the entire system, one must study not only policies in the authorization logic, but also hard-to-analyze implementation code.This paper proposes dkal ⋆ , a language for constructing executable specifications of authorization protocols. Protocol and policy designers can use dkal ⋆ ’s authorization logic for expressing distributed trust relationships, and its small rule-based programming language to describe the message sequence of a protocol. Importantly, many low-level details of the protocol (e.g., marshaling formats or management of state consistency) are left abstract in dkal ⋆ , but sufficient details must be provided in order for the protocol to be executable.We formalize the semantics of dkal ⋆ , giving it an operational semantics and a type system. We prove various properties of dkal ⋆ , including type soundness and a decidability property for its underlying logic. We also present an interpreter for dkal ⋆ , mechanically verified for correctness and security. We evaluate our work experimentally on several examples.},

In citeBH07, a policy language was presented having policy combinators based on Belnap logic, a four-valued logic in which truth values correspond to policy results of "grant", "deny", "conflict", and "undefined". We show here how policies in this language can be analyzed, and study the expressiveness of the language. To support policy analysis, we define a query language in which policy analysis questions can be phrased. Queries can be translated into a fragment of first-order logic for which satisfiability and validity checks are computable by SAT solvers or BDDs. We show how policy analysis can then be carried out through model checking, validity checking, and assume-guarantee reasoning over such translated queries. We also present static analysis methods for the particular questions of whether policies contain gaps or conflicts. Finally, we establish expressiveness results showing that all em data independent policies can be expressed in our policy language.},

But is this technology delivering the benefits to workflow and patient care promised by increased mobility? The authors conducted a systematic review to examine evidence regarding the impact of mobile handheld technology on hospital physicians' work practices and patient care, focusing on quantification of the espoused virtues of mobile technologies. The authors identified thirteen studies that demonstrated the ability of personal digital assistants (PDAs) to positively impact on areas of rapid response, error prevention, and data management and accessibility. The use of PDAs demonstrates the greatest benefits in contexts where time is a critical factor and a rapid response crucial. However, the extent to which these devices improved outcomes and workflow efficiencies because of their mobility was largely absent from the literature. The paucity of evidence calls for much needed future research that asks explicit questions about the impact the mobility of devices has on work practices and outcomes.},

In our work we present a systematic assessment of security critical areas in design and implementation of a secure container for Android using reverse engineering and attacker-inspired methods. We do this through a case-study of Samsung KNOX, a real-world product deployed on millions of devices.

	title = {A {UK} perspective on smartphone use amongst doctors within the surgical profession},
	abstract = {Introduction
Hospitals are increasingly looking for mobile solutions to meet their information technology needs. Medical professionals are using personal mobile devices to support their work, because of limitations in both time and space. Our aims were to assess smartphone use amongst UK surgical doctors, the prevalence of medical app use and online activity.
Methods
A thirteen-item questionnaire was derived to identify the proportion of surgical doctors of all grades using smartphones within the workplace. The following factors were evaluated: use of medical apps; use of online medical resources and if users were willing to use their own smartphone for clinical use.
Results
A total of 341 participants were surveyed with a complete response rate: 93.5\% of which owned a smartphone, with 54.2\% of those owning medical apps and 86.2\% using their device to access online medical resources.

Junior doctors were more likely to use medical apps over their senior colleagues (p = 0.001) as well as access the Internet on their smartphone for medical information (p \&lt; 0.001).

Overall, 79.3\% stated that they would be willing to use their smartphone for clinical use, which was found not to be dependent on seniority (p = 0.922).
Conclusion
Online resources contribute significantly to clinical activities with the majority of smartphone users willing to use their own device. The information gathered from this study can aid developers to create software dedicated to the smartphone operating systems in greatest use and to potentially increase the use of a bring your own device (BYOD) scheme.},

	abstract = {As computing technology becomes more pervasive and broadband services are
deployed into residential communities, new applications will emerge for the
home and community environment. These applications will assist people in a
variety of daily activities by enabling them to create, access, and
manipulate information about the residents and resources in their homes. In
a connected community, resources in the home and information about the
residents of the home will be remotely accessible to both residents and
guests, as well as to potentially malicious users. These new applications,
as well as their users and environment, pose new security challenges. The
challenges stem from two factors: the nature of the home itself---a private
space with a wealth of personal and sensitive information---and the limited
technical knowledge and capabilities of the home's residents.

We are addressing the problem of securing applications that will access and
control information resources in the home of the future. Specifically, we
are designing a security system based on a paradigm called Generalized
Role-Based Access Control (GRBAC). GRBAC is an extension of traditional
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). It enhances traditional RBAC by
incorporating the notion of object roles and environment roles, with the
traditional notion of subject roles. These new types of roles allow one to
define rich, easy-to-understand security policies without having significant
technical knowledge of the underlying computer systems that implement those
policies. In this paper, we motivate the need for GRBAC, provide a
high-level description of it and demonstrate its usefulness and flexibility
via several example applications.},

To guard against modeling artefacts we provide an alternative lattice based way of characterizing the policy combining operators and we formally prove the equivalence of these approaches thereby increasing our faith in either one. We then discuss several ways of extending XACML: one direction is to extend XACML with new combining operators, and another direction is to incorporate the notion of conflict into XACML. We conclude by discussing the possibility of analysing XACML policies for gaps and conflicts.},

This paper presents a comprehensive approach to trust management, based on a simple language for specifying trusted actions and trust relationships.

	abstract = {The emerging Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) paradigm is pushing the adoption of employees’ personal mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) inside organizations for professional usage. However, allowing private, general purpose devices to interact with proprietary, possibly critical infrastructures enables obvious threats. Unfortunately, current mobile OSes do not seem to provide adequate security support for dealing with them. In this paper, we present a formal modeling and assessment of the security of mobile applications. In particular, we propose a security framework for verifying and enforcing BYOD security policies on Android devices. Interestingly, our approach is non-invasive and only requires minor platform modifications at application level. Finally, we provide empirical evidence of the practical feasibility of the approach by means of a prototype which we used to validate a set of real Android applications.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems is a complete and accessible account of the theoretical foundations and computational methods that underlie plausible reasoning under uncertainty. The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic.The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty--and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition--in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information.Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.},

@book{kolovski_logic-based_2007,
	title = {Logic-{Based} {Access} {Control} {Policy} {Specification} and {Management}},
	abstract = {Abstract. Recently there has been a great amount of attention to access control languages that can cover large, open, distributed and heterogeneous environments like the Web. These languages aim to be flexible and extensible, with enough features to capture expressive and distributed security policies. However, with expressive languages such as XACML or WS-Policy, users have problems understanding the overall effects and consequences of their security policies. Even the task of checking that the policy will not result in leakage of permissions to an unintended or unauthorized principal is tedious and error-prone when done manually. As a result, there has been a great amount of research on logic-based policy management that provides analysis services to help find inconsistencies/differences between access control policies. This paper provides an overview of the existing approaches for security (access control) policy analysis. The survey covers both language proposals that have formal semantics and provide algorithms for policy analysis out of the box, and formalizations of already existing policy languages (WS-Policy, XACML, XrML, ODRL) that provide a formal semantics and analysis services previously unavailable for the particular language. 1},

Several models for trust have been proposed in the literature but few explicitly take risk into account.

We then draw a model of the invested fraction of the capital function of a decision surface. We finally define a model of trust composed of a reliability trust as the probability of transaction success and a decision trust derived from the decision surface.},

As a matter of fact, today smartphones and tablets have remarkable hardware profiles and a cornucopia of applications. Yet, the security mechanisms offered by most popular mobile operating systems offer only limited protection to the threats posed by malicious applications that may be inadvertently installed by the users and therefore they do not meet the security standards required in corporate environments. In this paper we propose a security framework for mobile devices that ensures that only applications complying with the organization security policy can be installed. This is done by inferring behavioral models from applications and by validating them against the security policy.

DKAL enables flexible use of functions; in particular principals can quote (to other principals) whatever has been said to them. DKAL strengthens the trust delegation mechanism of SecPAL.

As a result, issues associated with the resource perspective, i.e., the people and machines actually doing the work, have been largely neglected. Although the process perspective is of most significance, appropriate consideration of the resource perspective is essential for successful implementation of workflow technology. Previous work has identified recurring, generic constructs in the control-flow and data perspectives, and presented them in the form of control-flow and data patterns. The next logical step is to describe workflow resource patterns that capture the various ways in which resources are represented and utilised in workflows. These patterns include a number of distinct groupings such as push patterns (“the system pushes work to a worker”) and pull patterns (“the worker pulls work from the system”) to describe the many ways in which work can be distributed. By delineating these patterns in a form that is independent of specific workflow technologies and modelling languages, we are able to provide a comprehensive treatment of the resource perspective and we subsequently use these patterns as the basis for a detailed comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems.},

In fact, employees are continually trying to incorporate their personal devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets, into the office to perform some of their work or simply to access the Internet with a device they trust or they are more familiar with. Unfortunately, several security issues may arise from all these external devices accessing the corporate network. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a framework that enforces on-the-fly instantiated policies inside organizations using trusted BYOD technologies. The proposed framework implements a role-based access control system based upon user identity and her current context. To this end, each user receives a specific policy from a server based upon the current role and context. The effective user identity is confirmed using OAuth 2.0, while the device integrity and policy enforcement is ensured by means of a on-device root-of-trust and an enforcer running on each device.},

The use of policies allows administrators to modify system behavior without changing source code or requiring the consent or cooperation of the components being governed. Early approaches to policy representation have been restrictive in many ways. However semantically-rich policy representations can reduce human error, simplify policy analysis, reduce policy conflicts, and facilitate interoperability. In this paper, we compare three approaches to policy representation, reasoning, and enforcement. We highlight similarities and differences between Ponder, KAoS, and Rei, and sketch out some general criteria and properties for more adequate approaches to policy semantics in the future.},

Many current BYOD security practices are costly to implement and intrusive to employees, which, to some degree, negate BYOD's perceived benefits. To address such tension, we propose prioritized defense deployment: Instead of employing the same costly and intrusive security measures on each BYOD smartphone, more stringent threat detection/mitigation mechanisms are deployed on those representative smartphones, each of which represents, security-wise, a group of smartphones in the whole BYOD device pool. To this end, we propose a concept and a distributed algorithm, both named T-dominance, to capture the temporal-spatial pattern in an enterprise environment. We identify a few desirable properties of prioritized defense deployment, and analytically show that T-dominance satisfies such properties. We complement our analysis with simulations on real Wi-Fi association traces.},

These systems expose previously unavailable phone and network resources to application developers. However, with increased exposure comes increased risk. Poorly or maliciously designed applications can compromise the phone and network. While Android defines a base set of permissions to protect phone resources and core applications, it does not define what a secure phone is, relying on the applications to act together securely. In this paper, we develop the Kirin security framework to enforce policy that transcends applications, called policy invariants, and provides an “at installation ” self-certification process to ensure only policy compliant applications will be installed. We begin by describing the Google Android security model and formally model its existing policy. Using relatively simple policy invariants describing realistic security requirements, Kirin identified insecure policy configurations within Android leading to vulnerabilities in core phone services, thereby motivating additional security framework defining system-wide policy.},

Hence there is benefit in any framework for policy composition that is intuitive, formal (and so “analyzable” and “implementable”), expressive, independent of specific application domains, and yet able to be extended to create domain-specific instances. Here we develop such a framework based on Belnap logic. An access-control policy is interpreted as a four-valued predicate that maps access requests to either grant, deny, conflict, or unspecified -- the four values of the Belnap bilattice. We define an expressive access-control policy language PBel, having composition operators based on the operators of Belnap logic. Natural orderings on policies are obtained by lifting the truth and information orderings of the Belnap bilattice. These orderings lead to a query language in which policy analyses, for example, conflict freedom, can be specified. Policy analysis is supported through a reduction of the validity of policy queries to the validity of propositional formulas on predicates over access requests. We evaluate our approach through firewall policy and RBAC policy examples, and discuss domain-specific and generic extensions of our policy language.},

We present Cassandra, a language and system for expressing policy, and the results of a substantial case study, a security policy for a national electronic health record system, based on the requirements for the ongoing UK National Health Service procurement exercise. Cassandra policies are expressed in a language based on Datalog with constraints. The expressiveness of the language (and its computational complexity) can be tuned by choosing an appropriate constraint domain. Cassandra is role-based; it supports credential-based access control (e.g. between administrative domains); and rules can refer to remote policies (for automatic credential retrieval and trust negotiation). Moreover, the policy language is small, and it has a formal semantics for query evaluation and for the access control engine. For the case study we choose a constraint domain C0 that is sufficiently expressive to encode many policy idioms. The case study turns out to require many subtle variants of these; it is important to express this variety smoothly, rather than add them as ad hoc features. By ensuring only a constraint compact fragment of C0 is used, we guarantee a finite and computable fixed-point model. We use a top-down evaluation algorithm, for efficiency and to guarantee termination. The case study (with some 310 rules and 58 roles) demonstrates that this language is expressive enough for a real-world application; preliminary results suggest that the performance should be acceptable.},

The security properties that these devices provide to their applications, however, are inadequate to protect against many undesired behaviors. A broad class of such behaviors is violations of simple information-flow properties. This paper proposes an enforcement system that permits Android applications to be concisely annotated with information-flow policies, which the system enforces at run time. Information-flow constraints are enforced both between applications and between components within applications, aiding developers in implementing least privilege. We model our enforcement system in detail using a process calculus, and use the model to prove noninterference. Our system and model have a number of useful and novel features, including support for Android’s single- and multiple-instance components, floating labels, declassification and endorsement capabilities, and support for legacy applications. We have developed a prototype of our system on Android 4.0.4 and tested it on a Nexus S phone, verifying that it can enforce practically useful policies that can be implemented with minimal modification to off-the-shelf applications.},

In this paper we present CRePE, the first system that is able to enforce fine-grained policies, e.g. that vary while an application is running, that also depend on the context of the smartphone. A context can be defined by the status of some variables (e.g. location, time, temperature, noise, and light), the presence of other devices, a particular interaction between the user and the smartphone, or a combination of these. CRePE allows context-related policies to be defined either by the user or by trusted third parties. Depending on the authorization, third parties can set a policy on a smartphone at any moment or just when the phone is within a particular context, e.g. within a building, or a plane.},

App Guarden is a new project that uses a flexible assurance framework based on distribution of evidence, attestation and checking algorithms to make explicit why an app isn’t dangerous and to allow users to describe how they want apps on their devices to behave. We use the SecPAL policy language to implement a device policy and give a brief example of a policy being used. Finally we use SecPAL to describe some of the differences between current app markets. 1},

	abstract = {Policies form an important part of management and can be an effective means of implementing self-adaptation in pervasive systems. Most policy-based systems focus on large-scale networks and distributed systems. Consequently, they are often fragmented, dependent on infrastructure and lacking flexibility and extensibility. This paper presents Ponder2, a novel policy system that is suitable for a wide range of environments and applications. The design and implementation of Ponder2 emphasises simplicity, flexibility and extensibility and provides users with the ability to interact easily with the managed system. Ponder2 can interact with other software and hardware components and is being used in environments ranging from single devices, to personal area networks, ad-hoc networks and distributed systems. We also describe PonderTalk, a high-level object orientated language inspired by Smalltalk for configuring and controlling Ponder2 systems.large scale systems. It advocates a similar de-centralised model of autonomous agents co-operating with each other and composing into more complex configurations. However, many existing policy-based frameworks have not been conceived for such environments. Their design is dependent on centralised infrastructure support such as LDAP directories and CIM repositories. Their deployment model is often based on centralised provisioning and decision-making that does not offer the means for policy execution components to interact with each other, collaborate or federate into larger structure. Policy specification is seen as an off-line activity, and policy frameworks do not easily interact with the managed system. Consequently such frameworks are difficult to install, run and experiment with. Additionally, they usually do not scale to smaller devices omnipresent in pervasive systems.},
